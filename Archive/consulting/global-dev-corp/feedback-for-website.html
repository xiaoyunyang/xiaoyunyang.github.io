I strongly advice against building a single page application for the landing page because static sites load faster and are more scrappable by google’s bots. Google's page ranking algorithm penalizes sites that run a lot of JavaScript or takes a long time to load all the content.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bad:</span>  PageSpeedInsight on your site says the web version of your site is very slow. The generated report, which you can access <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fglobal-dev-corp.herokuapp.com%2F&amp;tab=mobile">via this link</a>, gives you suggestions on you how to speed up your site.  I recommend using <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> to combine all the javascript and css files into one minified file. This should significantly improve your PageSpeed performance.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Good:</span>  There are meta tags for SEO and for social sharing. <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fglobal-dev-corp.herokuapp.com%2F">Facebook’s sharing debugger</a> does not provide any errors, just a few warnings.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bad: </span> The image should be resized because the text is cut off. This is what it looks like if I share it on Facebook:

I can barely read them without zooming in.

      <br/></div><div><br/></div></div><div><div><ol start="5"><li>[web] The “Programs” section of the webpage has a few issues:</li></ol><ul><ul><li>The hover over effect, which is supposed to change the color and underline properly of the text works but is a bit laggy. There’s a visible delay in the change after the hover event is triggered. This culminates in the appearance of a "shaky animation” to the end user. </li><li>It does not properly highlight the selected filter. Even after I press “Project Development”, it still has “All” highlighted, as shown below:</li></ul></ul></div><div>

When I press “Project Development”, it highlights both “All” and “Project Development”.</li></ol><div><br/></div><div><ol start="7"><li>[mobile] The little button on the right hand side that lets you go to the top of the page covers up some of the text as shown in the image below. I recommend you either adding padding to the main content of your page so the up arrow button doesn’t cover up the text or you make the TopNav sticky so it stays at the top of the screen no matter where you are on the page. I prefer the second approach, which I will discuss further in the Subjective Feedback section.<br/></li></ol></div><ol start="6"/><div><span>    <span>    <span>    <span>    </span></span></span></span>

You should be using third party applications.</li><li>Inspecting <span style="font-weight: bold;">        </span></li></ul></ul></div><div><div><br/></div><div><ol start="8"><li>[mobile] For the footer In the mobile view, I see two areas of improvement:</li></ol><ul><ul><li>The Facebook and twitter icon buttons in the footer are small and very close together. I don’t have fat fingers but I have trouble pressing the button I want. I suggest adding some more space between the buttons. There are some <a href="https://uxplanet.org/button-ux-design-best-practices-types-and-states-647cf4ae0fc6">guidelines available</a> to help you design the spacing and sizing of buttons for the best user experience on a mobile platform. I suggest using the latest version of the CSS framework of your choice. Most CSS frameworks have been updated to incorporate better layouts and optimizations for building a responsive webpage that works well on any device.</li><li>When I click the Facebook button, the tooltip shows up. This is because on a smart phone’s browser, one touch is equivalent to a hover over on a desktop’s browser.  The easiest way to fix this is simply to not have tooltip for the Facebook or twitter button since these are standard icons that everyone should know and immediately recognize.</li></ul></ul><div><br/></div><ol start="8"><ol/></ol></div><ol start="5"/><div><div><span>    <span>    <span>    <span>    <span>    <span>    </span></span></span></span></span></span>
                <img src="Feedback%20for%20Peter%20Preston.resources/web3.jpg"/></div></div></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subjective Feedback</span></div><div><ol start="1"><li>Unless you want to do something complicated with the website, I don't recommend having a server at all. I recommend <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> for collecting emails from visitors for the mailing list. MailChimp has a free tier that should take care of almost everything you need for a new startup or nonprofit that’s still growing.</li><li>The “Services” section is a carousel. I’m not a fan of the carousel as it makes the visitor of your site wait or have to interact with the carousel controller to access all the information. The rule of thumb is you have 10-20 seconds to grab the users' attention or give the users the information they needs before they leave the site. You should definitely not use the carousel component for the mobile app version of your site because it’s prone to "fat finger" errors.  I would recommend using response web components that load the top-to-bottom for the mobile version of the site and side-to-side for the web version as shown below:</li></ol><div><span>    <span>    <span>    
                  <img src="Feedback%20for%20Peter%20Preston.resources/Screenshot%202018-02-21%2021.03.01.png"/></span></span></span><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><ol start="3"><li>I recommend adding a sticky TopNav to the landing page.  This sticky TopNav should include a button to “Donate” and a button to sign up for the mailing list. These are the two main call to actions for your non-profit that I see thus far. Visitors of the webpage will always have these two buttons accessible no matter how far down they scroll on this page. This is desirable because as the visitor of the site scrolls through the webpage content, they may read something that resonate with them. You want to make it as easy as possible for them to sign up. You can read design books like <a href="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321965516/samplepages/0321965515.pdf">Don’t Make Me Think</a> for some additional ideas for how to design the user interface for your landing page to improve conversion rate (that is, the probability at which a visitor of the site sign up to become a customers or user of your product). </li></ol></div></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div>
