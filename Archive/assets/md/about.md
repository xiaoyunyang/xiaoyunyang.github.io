##### __Bio:__
Xiaoyun is an entrepreneur, engineer, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality">ENTJ</a> who finds joy in self-directed work. Xiaoyun studied Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Carnegie Mellon University, with a focus in distributed systems, machine learning, and signal processing. After getting her M.S. in ECE, Xiaoyun has been working at Naval Reactors at Washington, DC, providing design and operational oversight for the Navy's submarines and aircraft carries. She's passionate about software and data visualization and has started a few side projects while still working full time. One of these projects led her to helm her startup, LooseLeaf, as Founder and CEO.

##### __Mission Statement:__
My life aspiration is to help people find personal fulfillment in their work. This is a combination of two things I value: (1) living with purpose and (2) productivity. Jeff Bezos once remarked that we should aspire to achieve "Work-life harmony", which supports my view that we should spend our times doing things that are challenging, interesting, and provide a sense of purpose.

##### __FAQ:__
__What are my hobbies and interests outside of work?__

I like to work on interesting side projects, take a MOOCs to update my knowledge/skills, blog on <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@xiaoyunyang">Medium</a>, and read. I recommend anything written by Malcolm Gladwell.

I'm also an avid traveler, having been to many interesting places in Europe (paid for by couchsurfing). My most recent trip was to Japan.

__Why makes me I want to leave a job?__

The most important reason is a lack of harmony with my life goals. Opportunities there are limited for me to work on something that has an universal and non-controversial benefit to mankind. I want to work on something that provides opportunities for people to live a more productive and purposeful life, builds bridges, and closes gaps.

__What things am I looking to do more of in my next job and what am I looking to do less of?__

More of -  autonomy in _how_ I do my work. Work-life harmony. Open source contribution.

Less of - The clock-in-clock-out 9 to 5 job. I like more flexibility in when I work and where I work.

__What has been my favorite thing (most enjoyable) about my current job?__

What we do is to approve, disapprove, and provide comments for our contractors' recommendations to pursue the next step for a product based on the result of their design, analysis, or technical evaluation. What I liked the most about my work is the opportunity to be an active part of that creative process in shaping the final product (albeit limited because we don't actually directly work on the product). I love finding errors or areas of improvement in the recommendation. I feel disatisfied if I straight up approved a recommendation with no comments - it makes me feel like I'm a passive organism. I like being a contrarian and an active participant in introducing change and progress. Of course this need has to be balanced with the need to meet deadlines.  I stay really late at work and work weekends in order to find errors and areas of improvement so the deadline doesn't need to be sacrificed to satisfy my needs to be an active participant in making the final product better. I love the system we have in which there's a formal process for other people I work with to provide their feedback to making my comments for the recommendation better.


__What has been my least favorie thing about my current job?__

As stated above, we are not a creative agent (we are an oversight of creative agents) so my current work can't entirely satisfy my creative itch (thus explaining the side projects); but that's not my least favorite thing about my current job.  My least favorite thing has to be the 9 to 5. Because of the sensitivity of the information we work with, we can't bring our work home. Most of my coworkers have children at home or live really far away from home (DC is expensive) so most of them leave promptly at 5. Not all of our work is "putting out fires" and we get many "small projects", each with a dealine, so we work them all in parallel and have the freedom to decide when and where to your allocate effort. This freedom is overshadowed by the 9 to 5 constraint. Most of the work we do require research and communication, which could be accomplished independently or via email correspondence, respectively. Many people do not respond to emails after 5 so if you get stuck and need help, you have to wait until the next day. Putting something down when you are in the middle of intense concentration and engagement with your work is disruptive to [the flow](https://books.google.com/books/about/Flow.html?id=epmhVuaaoK0C&hl=en). This would be a less of an issue if you worked on open-source software.

__What was a difficult challenge from my previous job?__

There was a project for which I was the lead engineer for my organization. We prepared about a years for it, did everything we could to mitigate all the risks we could think of. When the time came to execute the job, a serious issue came up. It was a high-stakes job and the consequence of making a serious mistake was huge. I got a group of people together and we worked out the problem together successfully. We proceeded quickly with caution. Being a part of this project taught me an important life lesson - you can't prepare for everything but having a good relationship with your team and mastering the art of [satisficing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Satisficing) (satisfactory and sufficient decision making strategy) is going to get you through any kind of challenge.

__How did my previous manager describe me?__

Attention to detail, willing to put in more hours than the 9 to 5 to get the job done.

__What side projects am I currently working on?__

* Japan App: (see repo: [japan-app](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/JapanApp) - I made this mobile app to help me plan my trip to Japan with friends. This project also got my feet wet in cross-platform mobile app development in ReactNative.

* App for work: (see repo: [github-for-work](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/github-for-work) - it compiles markdown files from coworkers. Provide method to quickly access how-to documents.

__Where do I see yourself in 5 years / 10 years?__

I will be working in a "scalable" profession, i.e., one in which rather than getting paid by the hour where your output is limited by physical limitations of how much labor/hours I can put in.

Preferably, I will be working in NYC at a startup that helps connect employment and educational opportunities to people looking to improve themselves. Being able to working on or with open-source software is a must.

__Would I rather be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?__

That's an interesting question but career ambition it's the wrong question for our reality. It should be "would you rather be (1) a slightly bigger fish in a small pond full of small fish or (2) a big fish in a big pond full of small fish".

I would pick (2).

__What's my experience like being a female engineer?__

You are going to have a lot of guy friends. That's not a motivation for girls to become engineers. It's just a inevitable side effect.
