## Use These Templates to Answer Job Interview Questions

An art is just a type of pseudo science that has not been fully formalized yet. In this article, I'm going to make my best attempt to formalize the art of interviewing for a position in a startup or tech company.

There are patterns in languages

### The Basis For Common Interview Questions 
No matter what job you are interviewing for, you will be asked these following questions in some shape or form. To properly prepare for a response, you have to understand the motivation for asking these questions. Interview questions are designed to gauge whether you are a good fit for the company. There are three general concerns:

1. __Are you aligned with the company's short term and long term vision?__

	The candidate having vested interest in creating future value for the company is the single most important question you must answer when interviewing for a startup. As equity is almost always in the compensation package, hiring to startups is essentially equal to bringing on a co-owner. It is dangerous for a startup to bring on someone is not fully committed to the mission and is only in for the short-term benefits. For more mature companies, employees not having proper alignment can still endanger the overall performance, but will not break the company.

2. __Do you have the skills, knowledge, and experience to be a productive member of the company?__

	There's a reason job postings include the "Skills Required" and "Knowledge Needed" fields. Training a new employee can be expensive and companies hire because there's a set of specific work that has to be completed and a person is missing at the company to complete that work. If you are interviewing for a large company that does its hiring through the HR department, their criteria for hiring is focused around matching talents with tasks. 
	
	The other important consideration for the talent match up is to evaluate the growth potential for the prospective employee. It is expensive to train a new employee and it is arguably more expensive to fire an employee. You might come in with the right skill set to fit the current need of the company, but as the company evolves, your current skill set might become inadequate or irrelevant.  This is especially true for people working in industries focused on innovation. Companies look for people who proactively work on self improvement, whether it'd be self education, relevant side projects, or earning more credentials such as a professional engineer license (???) or graduate or post-graduate degrees. 

3. __How well will you get along with the rest of the team?__

	Chances are that you are not the first hire of the company. For a small to mid-size company and especially a startup, bad relationship between the team members can fracture the team and can even cause the company to fail. An attribute of PayPal that contributed to its success was the tightly knit team at the start, known as the "PayPal Mafia". Many former PayPal cofounders and early employees supported each other to create many successful tech companies such as YouTube, Yelp, and LinkedIn. You see the same pattern with Facebook's early employees.

### The Templates

Now we discussed the principles behind the templates, here are the templates as promised. You should do your research ahead of each interview to construct the sentences, which you can then memorize and deliver during the interview. I always find it useful to do this level of preparation before an important event because it helps to lower stress and boost confidence.


#### Why do you want to work here?
As discussed in the principles section above, there are some specific things the interviewer is looking for in your response. The right way to answer this question needs to include the three concerns related to how well of a fit you are for the company.

If you constructed sentences that are untrue or contrary to your actual belief, that suggests that you are applying to the job for the wrong reasons. Save yourself the trouble and look for other opportunities. The template is effectively also a test for yourself to evaluate whether the job or company you are applying to is a rignt fit for you 


#### Why should I hire you?
Your response needs to emphasize how your experience and current skill set match up with the job requirements. If they don't match up 100 percent, then talk about your initiatives to work on those areas which you currently lack in. Saying that you will start working on these areas holds less weight than saying that you have already started working on them.

#### What do you like to do in your free time?
##### A variant of the question is How do you spend your Saturdays?
The wrong answer here is to say that you like to work in your free time. The purpose of this question is to understand how well you will get along with your potential future coworker. The correct way to respond to this question is to indicate how and why you will get along with the existing team members. This requires doing some research ahead of time. Fortunately, many company websites include bio of the team members or a page about what it is like to work at the company. needs to include You need to do some research. Your homework should be to go to that company's 'Team' page and scan for hobbies and background information from the team members. Visit their personal websites, blogs, social media accounts etc. Then when you give the answer, formulate the response to highlight your commonalities with the team members. 

__Pro Tip__: If you knew who's going to interview you ahead of the time, do an extensive research on that person to give a response that makes that person like you more. 

It is also a plus to talking about what you do with coworkers from your previous job, such as going out to happy hours, organizing or attending office parties, and collaborating on some personal projects together.
This shows that you put effort into forming a good relationship with people you work with.

The second part of the response deals with the proactive self improvement piece. The tricky part is to not come across as a workaholic. You need to balance your free time spent on leisure and team building activities with the free time spent on doing more work. 

__Pro Tip__: Talk a hobby that is both relaxing/fun and benefits you in the self improvement department. Some examples are blogging (writing and/or web design skills), volunteering (event organization, social skills), art or design (practice your creative muscle).

### Final Thought
If you are unable to complete the ad libs in these templates, then that's a sign that you are missing some experiences that you need acquire before you apply to the job. This can be as simple as scheduling a hiking trip with a friend from work, or enroll yourself in a MOOC on Coursera.

The other important thing to keep in mind when answering these questions is to always support your claims with examples. If you tell the interviewer that you work on your skills in your free time, explain exactly how you work on your skills. If you say that you have a great relationship with your current coworkers, give an example of the recent thing you did together. If you don't support your claims with examples, the interviewer will surely ask for an example in a followup question, so be sure to prepare for that.
