#### Hello!

I'm a software engineer. I make web and mobile applications in my spare time because I like to build things and create products to help make the world a better place for the average person. I live in Washington DC and in the past, I lived in NYC; Pittsburgh; Shanghai, China; and Bonn, Germany. I have a full time job and a side hustle. I'm a government employee by day, tech entrepreneur by night. I'd like to make my side hustle my main hustle.

Here are some more facts about me in list form:

## Work Experience
* I'm a founder of a startup called LooseLeaf, which is a web app that disrupts the higher education industry.
* I helped a friend create the first mobile apps for NumberShapes that teaches little kids essential math skills and number sense.
* I've worked at Naval Reactors as a full time job since college. My job included providing technical oversight of contractor work through reviewing functional requirements and design specification for safety critical embedded systems software.
* See [My Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_uByl2mOTJIVTM3ZWRYRVpIcWs/view) for my skills and experience

## Education
* I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering Carnegie Mellon University.
* I got a B.S. and a M.S in 4.5 years through an integrated bachelors and masters program.

## Miscellaneous
* I commissioned in 2013 through the Navy Reserved Officer Training Corp (ROTC)
* I have a 5 year commitment to work for the government supporting the US Navy because the Navy paid 3.5 years of college tuition.

**PS**:  If you are wondering how I built this website, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static site generator engine and the beautiful [tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) theme. I'm [hosting it from github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/). I wrote a [blog post](/post/using-hugo-to-build-a-personal-brand-website/) about this.
