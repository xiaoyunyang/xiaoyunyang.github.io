#### Hello!

I'm a software engineer and tech entrepreneur living in New York. I have a full time job at a startup and bootstrapping my own startup. In my spare time I like to contribute to open source software and blog.

I'm excited by opportunities that let me develop elegant solutions for obvious problems where there are no obvious solutions. I believe in automating wherever possible, and leveraging existing technology to quickly bootstrap solutions. My mantra is trial and error, which I apply to both building a startup as well as living a fulfilling life.

Here are some details about me:

## Work Experience

* I work at a software company called Smartling.
* I'm a founder of a startup called LooseLeaf, which is a web app that disrupts the higher education industry. [Read more](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/creating-looseleaf-a-platform-to-support-the-future-of-work/) about what I've done so far.
* I helped a friend create the first mobile apps for NumberShapes that teaches little kids essential math skills and number sense. [Read more](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/creating-numbershapes-math-learning-mobile-apps/) about what I did at NumberShapes.
* I've worked at Naval Reactors as a product manager since graduating college in 2013. While working at Naval Reactors, I was also an active duty Navy officer.
* I've completed various programming side projects for fun, sharpening my skills, and to improve the lives of myself, my friends, and co-workers. These side projects include building a [React Native mobile app](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/building-a-react-native-travel-app/) to help me and my friends plan an upcoming trip to Japan.
* I enjoy technical writing, especially [blogging about programming topics](/categories/blog/) that I'm still learning. I enjoy the process of putting complicated things in simple terms, drawing analogies and illustrating the concept with clarifying examples. Best of all, I think trying to explain what you think you know could lead you to discover knowledge gaps, which motivates more learning.

## My Super Power

My super power is my extreme attention to details without losing sight of the big picture and I always challenge my assumptions and continuously critique everything I do to make adjustments as necessary. I recognize the importance of details in affecting the final outcome, as accumulation of small mistakes leads to failure. Being result-driven, I'm dedicated to working out these details even if they are not so glorious or interesting. My ability to prioritize helps me work strategically and smartly applying resources.

**PS**:  If you are wondering how I built this website, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static site generator engine and the beautiful [tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) theme. I'm [hosting it from github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/). I wrote a [blog post](/post/using-hugo-to-build-a-personal-brand-website/) about this.
