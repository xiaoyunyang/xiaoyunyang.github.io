#### Hello!

I'm a software engineer and tech entrepreneur. I'm excited about developing elegant solutions for obvious problems where there are no obvious solutions. I believe in automating wherever possible, and leveraging existing technology to quickly bootstrap solutions. My mantra is trial and error, which I apply to both building a startup as well as living a fulfilling life.

I live in Washington DC and in the past, I lived in NYC; Pittsburgh; Shanghai, China; and Bonn, Germany. I have a full time job and a side hustle. I'm a government employee by day, tech entrepreneur by night. I'd like to make my side hustle my main hustle. In my spare time I like to read programming books and write articles about programming on Medium.

Here are some details about me:

## Work Experience
* I'm a founder of a startup called LooseLeaf, which is a web app that disrupts the higher education industry. [Read more](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/creating-looseleaf-a-platform-to-support-the-future-of-work/) about what I've done so far.
* I helped a friend create the first mobile apps for NumberShapes that teaches little kids essential math skills and number sense. [Read more](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/creating-numbershapes-math-learning-mobile-apps/) about what I did at NumberShapes.
* I've worked at Naval Reactors as a full time job since college. My job included providing technical oversight of contractor work through reviewing functional requirements and design specification for safety critical embedded systems software.
* I've completed various programming side projects for fun, sharpening my skills, and to improve the lives of myself, my friends, and co-workers. These side projects include building a [React Native mobile app](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/building-a-react-native-travel-app/) to help me and my friend plan an upcoming trip to Japan.

**PS**:  If you are wondering how I built this website, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static site generator engine and the beautiful [tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) theme. I'm [hosting it from github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/). I wrote a [blog post](/post/using-hugo-to-build-a-personal-brand-website/) about this.
