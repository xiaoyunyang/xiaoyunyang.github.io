#### Hello!

I'm a software engineer and tech entrepreneur living in New York. In my spare time I like to contribute to open source software and tech blogs.

I'm excited by opportunities that let me develop elegant solutions for obvious problems where there are no obvious solutions. I believe in automating wherever possible, and leveraging existing technology to quickly bootstrap solutions. My mantra is trial and error, which I apply to both building a startup as well as living a fulfilling life.

Here are some details about me:

### Side Projects

- **Blogging:** I enjoy technical writing, especially [blogging about programming topics](/categories/blog/) that I'm still learning. I enjoy the process of putting complicated things in simple terms, drawing analogies and illustrating the concept with clarifying examples. Best of all, I think trying to explain what you think you know could lead you to discover knowledge gaps, which motivates more learning.
- **New technology POC:** I create example projects that illustrates the implementation of a new library or new problem solving approach. These examples are hosted at [https://xiaoyunyang.com](https://xiaoyunyang.com).

## My Super Power

My super power is my extreme attention to details without losing sight of the big picture and I always challenge my assumptions and continuously critique everything I do to make adjustments as necessary. I recognize the importance of details in affecting the final outcome, as accumulation of small mistakes leads to failure. Being result-driven, I'm dedicated to working out these details even if they are not so glorious or interesting. My ability to prioritize helps me work strategically and smartly applying resources.

## Trivia

* I have the honor of serving 5 years of active duty in the military at Naval Reactors. I commissioned in 2013 through the Navy Reserved Officer Training Corp (ROTC).

**PS**:  If you are wondering how I built this website, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static site generator engine and the beautiful [tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) theme. I'm [hosting it from github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/). I wrote a [blog post](/post/using-hugo-to-build-a-personal-brand-website/) about this.
