#### Hello!

I'm a software engineer and tech entrepreneur. I'm excited by opportunities that let me develop elegant solutions for obvious problems where there are no obvious solutions. I believe in automating wherever possible, and leveraging existing technology to quickly bootstrap solutions. My mantra is trial and error, which I apply to both building a startup as well as living a fulfilling life.

I live in Washington DC. I have a full time job and a side hustle. I'm a government employee by day, tech entrepreneur by night. I'd like to make my side hustle my main hustle. In my spare time I like to read programming books and write articles about programming on Medium.

Here are some details about me:

## Work Experience
* I'm a founder of a startup called LooseLeaf, which is a web app that disrupts the higher education industry. [Read more](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/creating-looseleaf-a-platform-to-support-the-future-of-work/) about what I've done so far.
* I helped a friend create the first mobile apps for NumberShapes that teaches little kids essential math skills and number sense. [Read more](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/creating-numbershapes-math-learning-mobile-apps/) about what I did at NumberShapes.
* I've worked at Naval Reactors as a product manager since graduating college in 2013. While working at Naval Reactors, I was also an active duty Navy officer.
* I've completed various programming side projects for fun, sharpening my skills, and to improve the lives of myself, my friends, and co-workers. These side projects include building a [React Native mobile app](http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/building-a-react-native-travel-app/) to help me and my friends plan an upcoming trip to Japan.
* I enjoy technical writing, especially [blogging about programming topics](/categories/blog/) that I'm still learning. I enjoy the process of putting complicated things in simple terms, drawing analogies and illustrating the concept with clarifying examples. Best of all, I think trying to explain what you think you know could lead you to discover knowledge gaps, which motivates more learning.

## My Super Power
My super power is my extreme attention to details without losing sight of the big picture and I always challenge my assumptions and continuously critique everything I do to make adjustments as necessary. I recognize the importance of details in affecting the final outcome, as accumulation of small mistakes leads to failure. Being result-driven, I'm dedicated to working out these details even if they are not so glorious or interesting. My ability to prioritize helps me work strategically and smartly applying resources.

## Trivia
* I have the honor of serving 5 years of active duty in the military at Naval Reactors. I commissioned in 2013 through the Navy Reserved Officer Training Corp (ROTC).
* Here are some words that describe me:  Love learning, independent, pragmatic, inquisitive, adaptable, good communicator, diligent, attention to detail.
* I have a little dog called Ollie. He gives high-fives.
* I'm an immigrant. I moved to the US from China in 2002. I became a citizen in 2003.
* I've always lived in cities. The cities in which I've lived include Shanghai, New York, Pittsburgh, and Washington DC.
* When I was a college student, I spent a summer abroad studying German at the Goethe Institut in Bonn, Germany. During my stay, I traveled and couchsurfed alone all over Germany and Western Europe. It was a transformative experience. I learned so much about myself and gained a lot of confidence based on my experience being out of my comfort zone.
* I love traveling and enjoy [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/xiaoyun.yang.7). The best cities I've visited are Berlin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Vienna, Edinburgh, Oslo, and Tokyo.

**PS**:  If you are wondering how I built this website, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static site generator engine and the beautiful [tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) theme. I'm [hosting it from github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/). I wrote a [blog post](/post/using-hugo-to-build-a-personal-brand-website/) about this.
