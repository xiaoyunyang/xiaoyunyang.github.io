[NumberShapes](http://number-shapes.com) is a collection of mobile apps that make numbers come alive through numerical visualizations and interactions. In 2014, I worked on the software development for the first few apps, which are iOS matching games that help young learners with familiarization of addition, subtraction, multiplication and other math facts.

[AddTwo](http://www.148apps.com/app/913355047/) and [OverTen](http://www.148apps.com/app/913457693/) were among the first iOS apps that I created for NumberShapes.

The collection of NumberShapes apps has since grew and one of the apps (NumberShapes Whiteboard) received the [NumberShapes Whiteboard is an award winning app for chilren's technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8buAFObSpI) Editor's Choice Award from the Children's Technology Review</a>.

While the iOS development has been turned over to my co-founder, Andrew, I still support the development of NumberShape's website, including the [current official website](http://number-shapes.com) and a [prototype website](http://number-shapes.herokuapp.com/#/)"> with more features, which is being hosted on heroku. The prototype is created using angular.js, Foundation with SASS, node.js, and express.js.
