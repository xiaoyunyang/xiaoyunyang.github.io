I spent 6 hours today experimenting with sound production on the violin. This is week 2 of my violin learning journey.

People say that learning an instrument as an adult is more difficult than as a child. I disagree. Adults, given the right motivation and approach, have several advantages over children with regard to learning the skills and fundamental understanding for the science of using an instrument to produce sound.

There is a lot of math, physics, and biology (human anatomy) involved when playing a musical instrument. The violin is regarded as one of the most difficult instruments to learn because it requires the player to manipulate all the variables for tone production at a very low level.

In this post, I'll share some important insights from my first 2 weeks of playing the violin and my strategy for how to train in the coming months to be capable of playing some of my favorite pieces *beautifully* on the violin.

## My motivation for learning the violin

The violin is not my first instrument. I first learned to play the piano at age 3. As a child, I dreaded practicing the piano and stopped playing around age 10.

As a teenager, I begged my parents to buy me a guitar during a phase when I was really into metal and rock music. I wanted to reproduce my favorite riffs and chords on the guitar and play the instrument while singing my favorite tunes.

After college in my 20s, I started playing the piano again after falling in love with [the music from the animes](https://youtu.be/cmzZLmQb3xs?si=5sBTqaYWn01hje9o) I was binge watching. During this period, I eagerly practiced everyday to play the specific pieces.

Most recently, I was doom scrolling on Instagram one day and saw [this video](https://youtu.be/aRQ0zYkPl1k?si=viCKcy58rHqYcgp4) of a duet between a violinist and a pianist playing Vivaldi's Summer, the most exciting of his Four Seasons concerto series. I was awestruck by the violin part of the performance as the score spans a wide range of notes (about three octaves), perfectly showcasing the expressiveness of the violin as an instrument in conveying emotions. As I re-watched the video several times equipped with noise canceling headphones, I was able to hear distinct tone textures and the emotions they inspire.

I became instantly obsessed with violin music, listening to the greatest hits from the Baroque and Classical periods (the golden age of string quartets and chamber music), getting goosebumps from the rich, expressive, and mesmerizing tones of the violin.

I was so fascinated by the sound of the violin that I did not hesitate to go to a violin store to buy myself an instrument so I can experience the magic and unravel the science behind how the violin "sings".

## Learning The Violin As An Engineering Problem

The problem solving skills that I honed working as a software engineer have been instrumental in helping me achieve success in many of my life projects, including becoming a homeowner, making latte art, climbing the Matterhorn, and getting and maintaining a six-pack.

The foundations of effective problem solving have these three parts:

1. Thinking from first principles
2. Breaking down the problem into smaller parts and methodically solving each part and combining the solutions
3. Validate partial solutions, debug, and *refactor* as often and early as possible

In the context of playing the violin, the solution refers to the actual body mechanics involved in producing sounds on the violin.

Next, I'll share how I applied these engineering principles to learning the violin, my approach for how to develop the solution, and the results and learning I've achieved so far.

### Understanding the Science

#### Sliding Surfaces

When the bow is drawn across the string, the hair of the bow grabs onto the string and slide across the string with some friction, causing the string to vibrate.

In physics, this phenomenon is called kinetic friction (or dynamic friction). The amount of kinetic friction is proportional to the coefficient of friction between two surfaces and the normal force which acts perpendicular to the direction of relative motion.

In the context of the violin, the coefficient of friction is influenced by:

1. **The rosin on the bow hair**
   - *Rosin type:* Dark rosin tends to be stickier and softer, providing more grip, while light rosin is harder and less sticky.
   - *Quantity:* Too little rosin can result in a slippery, weak sound, while too much can cause excessive friction and produce a scratchy sound.
2. **Bow hair and string material and condition**
   - The material affects how well the bow hair grips the string.
   - Old, worn, or dirty bow hair provides less consistent friction. Similarly, Worn or dirty strings provide inconsistent friction and can negatively affect the sound.

There are other factors like temperature and humidity which can affect the coefficient of friction but we will only focus on the variables which are in our control.

The normal force is influenced by:

1. **Weight of the bow**
   - When bowing at the frog, the bow weight's contribution to the normal force is the highest. Conversely, when bowing at the tip, the weight contribution is the lowest.
2. **The pressure the player induces on the bow**
   - The player can add or remove normal force on the bow by controlling elbow height, forearm rotation, and wrist, and the extension and flexion of the fingers in the bowing arm.

Understanding the physics of kinetic friction can be extremely useful when diagnosing issues in bowing such as why the bow is sliding around, making screechy, or scratchy sounds.

**The tension of the bow** and **the bow tilt**, although not directly contributing to the kinetic friction, play a large role in the tone quality because they affect how much hair is in contact with the string.

For instance, high bow hair tension produces a brighter and more powerful sound and is appropriate when the piece requires aggressive or fast playing using advanced techniques like spiccato or staccato where a quick response is needed. However, tighter hair requires precise control from the player to manage the increased pressure and reduced contact area to prevent the bow from skidding and bouncing.

Low bow tension offers more forgiveness and ease of producing a consistent tone and helps to produce a softer, mellower sound. Low bow tension is appropriate for lyrical passages requiring legato and smooth, continuous playing. However, too much looseness can create a loss of clarity and volume.

Playing with a bow tilt (When the bow is tilted towards the fingerboard) can also contribute to softness and lower volume of the sound being produced by the bowing because it decreases the contact area between the hair and the string.

#### String Vibration

Once you get intonation and rhythm, what separates good playing from great playing is resonance. To understand resonance, we need to first build some knowledge for harmonic series and overtones.

Overtones are the essentially the other pitches around the main pitch that are quieter than the main pitch. All the pitches that are produced when a note is played on a musical instrument is called the overtone series.

When you hear the overtone series together, our brain summarizes these pitches as a sound color. When the piano plays a C, it sounds different than when a violin plays a C. This is because The the instruments produce different overtone series.

[This video](https://youtu.be/NFo2AXf78xk?si=bQgFg45DsWpcrf4j) does an excellent job of explaining the overtone series and how it relates to the sound of different instruments.

Here we see the overtone series of the same note as played by different instruments:
![overtone series created by different instruments](/post/images/violin/overtones-of-instruments.png)

Making the violin “sing” is essentially the science of creating overtones that *resonate sympathetically* with the open strings on the violin (G, D, A, and E). What do we mean by sympathetic resonance?

Let's try this experiment:

*On the violin, play the high third finger on each of the D, A, and E strings in first position and observe that the open string that corresponds with the note (open A, Em, and G strings) actually vibrates!*

When the open string vibrates in sympathy with the note you are playing, you get a richer, fuller sound. This is why we want to always tune the violin before playing. A violin resonates particularly well if you play it in tune because it picks up the sympathetic vibrations from open strings.

To develop the strategies for maximizing resonance and overtone on the violin, we need to first understand the factors that affect the vibration of the string.

1. **String tension**
   - String tension is first created when the string is tuned. On a violin, the strings are wound around the peg and the tension in the string can be changed when the pegs are loosened or tightened.
   - String tension is also directly proportional to (effective) string length. When you press down on fingerboard, you are making the string shorter. This lowers the effective string length, which increases the tension on the string.
   - The more tension, the higher the frequency of the vibration (and therefore, the higher the pitch).
   - Higher tension increases the speed of vibration, resulting in a more responsive bow-string interaction.
2. **Thickness of the string**
   - Thicker strings produce lower pitches compared to thinner strings when tuned to the same tension due to their larger mass and slower vibration.
   - The increased mass of thicker strings contributes to their greater inertia and slower vibration, resulting in a fuller tone with more emphasis on fundamental frequencies and lower harmonics. The result is a warmer, richer, and more resonant sound compared to thinner strings.
3. **The pressure being applied on the string by the bow**
   - Applying more pressure to the string increases its amplitude of vibration and a louder sound due to the greater the displacement of the string from its resting position (larger oscillation).
   - Increasing pressure on the string increases its tension, which in turn raises the pitch of the note produced.

Understanding the technical principles behind vibration helps to understand why bowing close to the bridge when the string is long creates a screechy sound. Longer strings have lower tension and vibrates slower. Bowing a long string close the bridge can cause uncontrollable vibrations and overtones as the increased distance between the bowing point and the fingerboard (where the string is stopped) allows for less damping.

Conversely, bowing close to the fingerboard when the string is short can produce a muffled, dull, or muted tone quality because too much damping is introduced on a shorter string that has more tension. The string is vibrating too fast and the bow is not able to grab onto the string to produce a full sound.

Players can influence the vibration at different string lengths by changing the **sounding point** of the violin (how close you are bowing to the bridge). Sound arises from the interaction between the bow, string, and bridge, and how it affects the vibration and resonance of the instrument. Bowing closer to the fingerboard reduces the string's responsiveness to the bow and creates more dampening effect, which is appropriate when the string is in lower tension (long string). Bowing closer to the bridge improves clarity for higher tension strings (short string) because the bow can grab onto the fast moving string more easily.

To produce beautiful resonant sounds, you have to create resonant notes and be aware of the overtones. Vibrato, which is a controlled oscillation of pitch, is a technique used to enhance the richness and warmth of the sound by creating more overtones.

Understanding resonance and overtones is the key to unlocking to beautiful violin tone production. You cannot have true legato without resonance. Even if the principle notes are connected, if your harmonics are not connected, you are playing separate notes instead a phrase.

### Problem Breakdown

The three priorities for a beginner violinist are intonation, tone quality, and posture.

### Solution Development

### Implementation Plan

### Validation Strategy

To develop and refine my palette for sound production on the violin, I have been applying these principles to my practice sessions.

Listening to recordings of what good violin playing sounds like will train your ear in recognizing tone quality.

## The Science Behind Sound Production

I believe that having learned the piano at a very early age helped to develop my ear for music. This is evident in being able to recognize the notes and chords in a song and being able to reproduce them on the guitar.

Applying optimal pressure and bowing at the optimal sounding point for every string tension at every contact point between the bow and the string, for every string seems an extremely complex computational challenge. There are so many combinations and there is no one size fits all solution for the specific body mechanics because everyone has different bodies.

Fortunately, we have the ability to adjust our playing in real-time based on the feedback we get from the sound we produce, the vibrations we are feeling in the violin, and the pressure we are feeling the violin pushing back on our violin bowing arm (Newton's Third Law of Motion).

Finding the optimal finger positions.

## Priorities For A Beginner

### Intonation

To refine my ear for intonation, I practice playing scales and arpeggios in different keys. I always re-tune every string at the beginning of my practice session and after a few hours of bowing.

have been practicing scales and arpeggios in different keys. I have also been using a tuning app to check the pitch of the notes I am playing.

I listen to recordings of the pieces played by professional violinists to get a sense of what good violin playing sounds like.

JS Bach, a prolific composer of the Baroque period, is known for his solo violin works. His compositions are often used as teaching material for violin students because they are technically challenging and require the player to have a good understanding of the music theory behind the piece.

I made playlists of Bach compositions based on the scale (e.g. D minor).

### Tone Quality

### Posture and Form

- There's a balance point in the middle of the bow.

Which configuration of finger placement on the fingerboard produces the notes of this composition with the most ease?
