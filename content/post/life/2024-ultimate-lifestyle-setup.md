How I have my life set up in 2024.

## Personal Finance

A big part of wealth management is to manage spending in such a way that you grow your wealth. I don't mean wealth in those abstract terms like "happiness" or "fulfillment". I mean wealth in the most concrete terms: money.

This may sound counter intuitive. You may ask, "Don't I always lose money whenever I spend money?"

Yes, you do lose money whenever you spend money, but your wealth can grow if you smartly spend your money.

### The Cash Flow Equation

Your wealth as measured by your net worth, is calculated by:

```math
Net worth = Assets - Liabilities
```

Net worth grows if your money-in exceeds money-out.

As you earn more income and get interests from a high APY emergency funds savings account (liquid assets), and invest your money (illiquid asset), you get money in. Some of it gets cancels out by your liabilities (money out).

If your liabilities grows just as fast or faster than your asset, then that will cause your net worth to stagnate and even decrease over time.

How do we lower our liabilities?

I'm not going to say "by spending less money" because that implies a behavioral change, forming new habits, uprooting our lives, and re-evaluating our value systems, which are not easy to achieve or worth doing in many cases for the amount of money it saves.

Instead, I will introduce some ways to spend the money you have to spend already in a different way to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

### Think Like a Fund Manager

A fund manager's job is to grow a pool of wealth by spending money to make more money.  They put money into various asset classes like stocks, bonds, and debt financing with the expectation that more money will be returned with interest when the asset grows.

The goal is not incur a loss when they spend that money by selecting appropriate capital deployment strategies that maximize return and minimize losses for their clients based on the client's appetite for risk.

In the context of personal finance, we also start with a pool of money after payday that we can decide how to spend. The main difference is that we are both the client and the fund manager for our own personal fund.

#### Reduce Liabilities

There are living expenses that we must cover with that pool of money. These include paying rent, utilities, taxes, groceries, medical expenses, etc just like the fund manager has to use some of their clients' money to pay office rent, legal fees, taxes, and business operation costs. There's a cost for doing business/being alive which we cannot ignore.

There are many ways to reduce our liabilities. The most common advise you may hear is to make some lifestyle cuts like moving to a cheaper apartment, not going to restaurants as often, and taking public transit instead of Uber. While these are effective ways to reduce liabilities, they are not easy to implement or that desirable.

Fund managers are also thinking about ways to reduce their liabilities but they are not doing so by giving themselves a pay cut or reduced bonuses. Some examples include setting up their business entities in a way that minimizes fees and taxes and purchasing insurance to minimize their losses when there is a lawsuit.

In the context of personal finance, we can also think about ways to reduce our liabilities without making lifestyle cuts. Just for tax liabilities alone, there are so many simple hacks that many people are not aware of. These includes

- Setting up HSA to get a tax deduction for out-of-pocket medical expenses
- If you own a home, you can get a tax deduction for mortgage interest and property taxes
- If you have student loans, you can get a tax deduction for student loan interest
- [Keep your dividend stocks in a non-taxable account](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/060915/how-are-dividends-iras-taxed.asp) like Roth IRA so to instead of a taxable account like Traditional IRA.
- If you are self-employed or independent contractor, you can [get a tax deduction](https://www.freelancetaxation.com/what-should-freelancers-do-when-they-have-both-w-2-and-1099-income-and-expenses) for co-working spaces or home office expenses like internet and utilities and laptop.

Many of these changes are not worth making because the amount of money saved is not worth the amount of time and effort it takes to make the change.

After all the liabilities are paid, we have some money left over to spend on things that we will grow our wealth. This is where we can apply the same capital deployment strategies that fund managers use:

to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for the client.

There are different kinds of funds that cater to different kinds of investors. This ranges from mutual funds to hedge funds and crypto funds.

inevitably fees for managing these funds and running the business (salaries, taxes, legal fees) which are expenses that cannot be categorized as investments  that cannot be used to . The fund manager's job is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for the client while minimizing the fees.

In the context of personal finance specific to spending, we also start with a pool of money that we have to spend. There are living expenses that we have to pay for which are just the cost of doing business.

We can think of this pool of money as a fund that we manage. We can think of our spending as an investment in our lifestyle.

and we have to  you will always incur a loss when you spend; however we can rephrase our goal to one that focuses on **maximizing savings and minimizing losses**.

Savings comes in the form of cash back and point redemption for necessary travels. Losses come from paying interest on the credit card and spending above your means. Credit card reward incentive structures are designed to entice you to maximize loss. That’s how they make money.

When consumers pay their full statement balance on time, the credit card company loses money. This is why Goldman Sachs is pulling out of the Apple Credit Card is because Apple’s design is so good it encourages people to spend less money and pay their bills on time.

TODO: insert picture of Apple Credit Card and link to the Goldman Sachs breaking away from Apple Card.

This is also why the BILT mastercard, a credit card that rewards you 1x point for every dollar spent on rent, requires that you use the credit card at least 5 times per statement period to unlock the 1x point reward for rent.

### Capital Deployment Strategies

When you spend money, three things need to happen:

1. **Budgeting**  - You commit a certain amount of your liquid asset to pay for things in a certain category.
2. **Fundraising** - Getting your accounts ready to pay for the expenses. This involves making sure you have enough cash in your bank accounts to cover the credit card payments and making sure you have enough credit limit on your credit cards to cover the future expenses without going over 10% credit utilization (by paying down your credit cards).
3. **Fund Transfer** - How you pay for a transaction. This involves transferring money from one account to another, starting from your bank account where you set up your direct deposit and ultimately ending in the seller's account. Sometimes, multiple transfers for a single transaction is required (e.g. when a credit card is used).

A capital deployment strategy considers all three stages of the spending lifecycle, starting with categorizing the expenses to create budgets, creating the right accounts to fund for each expense, and setting up automation, policies, and protocols for each expense.

Starting with budgeting. We are used to

In general, there are two types of expenses in life.

1. **Everyday, necessary expenses.** These are routine, recurring, and predictable expenses, including rent, utilities, subscriptions, public transit, groceries, lunch takeout, and morning coffee.
2. **Non-routine discretionary expenses.** These can include small/medium expenses like restaurants, clothes shopping, and theater tickets to large expenses like plane tickets, hotels, and yoga retreats.
3. **Non-routine necessary expenses.** Medical and dental expenses.

The example expenses above are based on my spending habit. Your definition of routine and necessary may be different from mine. Heck, my definition next year may be different from this year. The point is to recognize the three styles of spending and apply the appropriate capital deployment strategies to maximize benefits and minimize excess spending.

### Spending Best Practices

Risk mitigation

- Minimize number of transfers for each transaction, especially the most important ones like rent
- Maximize predictability
- Maximize observability
-

Hygiene factors - these are necessities.

Quality of life improvements - for example, I got Spotify premium because I listen to a lot of music everyday and it's important to me to have a good music listening experience without ads, offline, and seamlessly on different devices.

Allocating financial resources to maximize value and minimize risks.

Minimize risk

- diversifying across different asset classes or fund deployment vehicles
- diversifying across different investment vehicles
- di

Set up and forget

These For example, I consider my Equinox membership a necessary expense because I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and I consider my climbing gym membership a non-routine discretionary expense because I go to the climbing gym 1-2 times a week.

Recognition of these two styles of spending is the first step in identifying and applying the appropriate capital deployment strategies to maximize benefits and minimize excess spending.

Everyday, necessary expenses which are predictable:

- **Rent and Utilities:** Maintenance fee, ConEd, Verizon
- **Subscriptions:** Entertainment (Spotify, Hulu), Expedited Delivery (Amazon Prime, DashPass), Cloud access (iCloud, Google, Notion, 1Password), Gym membership (Equinox, climbing gym)
- **Public Transit:** Subway
- **Everyday Food:** Grocery, takeout, coffee

A life hack is to have dedicated credit cards to put the predictable routine expenses and dedicated credit cards to put the non-routine expenses.

I use BILT for rent because the only alternative is to pay directly from my bank account. BILT gives you one ACH transfer per statement period for 1 point per $1 spent. As far as I know, this is the only credit card/financial product that gives you any reward for paying rent.

A caveat is that you must make at least 5 transactions per statement period to get the 1 point per $1 spent on rent. BILT takes a loss on the rent reward in hope that you would spend the card on other things. It uses these two tricks to encourage you to spend more money than you should:

1. Requiring a minimum of 5 transactions per statement period to unlock the 1 point per $1 spent on rent.
2. 3x points on restaurants and bonus points on "rent day" on which day expense you incur earns you doubles the normal points (6x on restaurants, 2x on rent, 2x everything else).

I only use BILT to pay my cable bill (because Verizon lets you pay using your credit card), and subway rides because those are low cost ways to satisfy the minimum transaction requirement paying for things I already need to pay.

Despite the tempting 6x points on dining on "rent day", it's quite dangerous to go out and spend money unnecessarily just to get the extra points. The way I think about it is this:

> Yes you can get a 6% discount on your restaurant bill by paying with this credit card, but you can get a 100% discount by not going to the restaurant.

The mindset to have is **not** how to maximize rewards and benefits from credit cards because that encourages lifestyle creep and spending more money than you need to. If you think that way, the credit card companies win.

The mindset is use the credit cards to get a discount on the things you need and are already buying.

it's the only  I get 1% cash back on rent and 2% cash back on subway. I use Venmo for everything else because I get 3% cash back on the highest spend category, 2% cash back on the second highest spend category, and 1% cash back on everything else.

There are exceptions to this rule. For example, I use Amex to pay for my Equinox membership because I get 3x points on gym membership and I use Amex Platinum to pay for my Equinox shop because I get 5x points on online shopping.

Vacation

- For buying flights with dollars, always use Amex Platinum because you always get 5 points per $1 spent on flights booked directly with airlines or with Amex Travel but you only get 2 points per $1 spent when you book directly with airlines using Chase Sapphire.
- For buying flights with points, use Sapphire Preferred because the [point redemption rate for travel is better](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-preferred-vs-amex-platinum) on Chase Ultimate Rewards than Amex Travel (1.25 cents/point vs 1 cent/point).
- For public transit expense, always use Sapphire Preferred because you always get 2 points per $1 spent (as opposed to 1 point per $1 spent on Amex Platinum).
- Always use Sapphire Preferred to book hotels because you can always get 2 points per $1 spent (versus 1 point using Amex). Although both credit cards offer hotel credits and 5x rewards when you use their portals to book hotels, I book all my hotels using Booking.com or Airbnb because I get better deals and more variety when I book with these dedicated hotel booking sites directly.
