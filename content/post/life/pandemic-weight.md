When the world went into a lockdown in 2020, you've probably seen memes like this:

![bread rolling stomach fat meme]()

and this:

![another pandemic weight gain meme]()

As all the gyms were closed and people turned to food for comfort in this time of uncertainty and social isolation, it is no wonder Pandemic 20 became a trend and our new reality.

In March 2020, I was in the best shape of my life. I thought I could not get more fit than this (boy was I wrong).

![March 2021 abs pic]()

Before I begin telling the story of how I lost my pandemic weight post-lockdown, I need to give some background on what shape I was in pre-lockdown. The processes for going from overweight to fit and from skinny fat to having a six pack cannot be more different.

## Chapter 1: Overweight to Fit

In a short period of 8 months, I had gained a ton of weight after moving to New York. The late night drinking, dining out, and inconsistent exercise contributed to me being on the edge of overweight from a BMI standpoint.

I was at my heaviest in August 2019 when I decided to join a weight loss challenge with my friends. It wasn't so much of a competition as we all had our individual weight loss and fitness goals. The deadline for reaching our goal was December 31, 20219.

The first thing we did was to start a group chat where we shared our progress, what exercises we did each day, pictures of food that we are eating, selfies documenting our body transformation, and screenshots of smart scale readouts.

The social accountability really helped with overcoming the initial friction of going to the gym everyday. Once going to the gym became a routine, it became much easier to keep going.

_The hardest part of going to the gym is to show up._

The Power of Habits says ...TODO: quote from the book

Establish a routine of exercising so you don't even have to think about it. I carve out time in my week to exercise and I put it on my calendar. When things are on my calendar, I'm more likely to do it.

### What Exercise to Do

If your body is not used to exercising everyday and you start exercising everyday, even if you just walk on the treadmill for an hour, you are going to see results.

In my first 2 months, I shrank 2 sizes and lost 15 lbs by just casually walking on the elliptical for an hour and use the weight machines in the gym for an hour. I did that everyday. I wasn't pushing myself with any of the exercises. My only goal in the beginning was to just show up to the gym everyday and do SOMETHING.

By month 3, the moderate exercising I was doing became too easy. I wasn't even sweating anymore on the elliptical.

This was the first plateau.

To overcome a plateau, the most effective way is not to do more of the same thing but to do more difficult things.

My gym offered group fitness classes. I started attending at least one high intensity interval training (HIIT) class or a sculpting class everyday.

TODO: study about HIIT class on losing fat. Favor HIIT over steady state cardio [EPOC afterburn effect](ttps://dailyburn.com/life/fitness/epoc-afterburn-effect/).

The classes replaced my hour of self-guided weight training.

For cardio, I switched from the elliptical to steady state running on the treadmill. I also joined a local running club ([TMIRCE]()) that organizes a casual group run every Saturday. You could run at your own pace for as far as you want. The members are people of all ability levels, from non-runners checking the group out for the first time to elite marathon runners. You can run with people in your own ability group or by yourself. At the end of the run, you could grab some healthy food, water, and coffee available after the run at Lululemon (TMIRCE's sponsor) and socialize with the people in the running group.

The gym classes and running helped me overcome my first plateau. I think if I started my weight loss journey with those, it would have been too hard and I would have burned out early and lose motivation. Because I was already training on my own before with moderate exercising and got into a good enough shape, I was able to take on this level 2 training and stayed with it.

### Dieting

There's a saying: Abs are made in the kitchen.

But I think it's more accurate to say: Abs are made in the gym and _revealed_ in the kitchen.

Just like exercising, you don't want to jump into a strict diet right away. I was used to eating a lot of food and drinking a lot of alcohol. My body was craving certain food and needed a lot of food to feel full.

The science says you will lose weight if you burn more calories than you consume.

I didn't want to sacrifice the lifestyle I was living or give up the wonderful food I have access to in New York. So I tried intermittent fasting.

I did a non-strict version of intermittent fasting with certain established rules:

1. I could eat anything I wanted but only for dinner after I had gone to the gym.
2. Stop eating when you feel full.
3. If I get hungry during the day, I was only allowed to snack on lean protein like grilled chicken breast and healthy fat like avocado and nuts.
4. No beers.

The main benefit of this diet is I didn't have to think about what I could or could not eat and I didn't have to count calories.

For a diet to be sustainable, it cannot be perceived as a punishment. I still allowed myself to dine at my favorite restaurants and cocktail bars. The no beer rule was created because beers contain a lot of empty calories. You need more beers to get the same effect as hard liquor so you tend to drink more beers. Giving up beer does not detract from the nightlife experiences I wanted to have in New York.

The "eat whatever you want after the gym" rule lends itself to being a explicit reward for going to the gym, which created a positive feedback to building a healthy lifestyle.

Snacking during the day is important because it reduces the chance of your body going into starvation mode which has an adverse effect on your metabolism. Snacking on protein helps you [lose weight without conscious calorie restriction](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-protein-can-help-you-lose-weight) because it reduces appetite and makes you eat fewer calories.

### How Long Until You See Results

In the first three months, I was losing 2-3 pounds every week, which is a healthy amount to lose. Anything above that is a red flag. Not only is it unsustainable, it could be a detriment to your long-term fitness goals. Losing weight too quickly from extremely strict diet and exercising signals your body that you might not have enough food to sustain your physical activity level. Your body will kick into starvation mode to reduce your resting metabolism, muscle building, and fat burning.

Your body is also very good at resisting change. If you established a pattern of unhealthy diet and no exercise, then you start eating really clean and exercising everyday, it will take about 2-4 weeks for your body to adapt to that new lifestyle and start dropping the weight.

Losing weight is not so much of a task as it is a **lifestyle change**.

So don't be discouraged if you don't see yourself losing a ton of weight within the first few weeks of you get into the healthy diet and exercising routine. It will happen and when it happens,the change will be very dramatic!

## Second Plateau

After having the weight loss challenge concluded in December 2019, I thought I was in the best shape of my life. I was really motivated (mainly out of curiosity) to continue doing a personal fitness challenge to see how far I could take my fitness and if I could get a six pack.

For two months. I really hit the gym hard.

This included 2-3 HIIT class per day, 5 days a week; running every day; and adhering to a very strict diet with tightly controlled portion sizes, removing things like bread and rice entirely from my diet.

But I noticed I wasn't making any progress.

I would drop a few pounds (mostly water weight) and look leaner during the week, then for one day when I didn't exercise, I would gain all the weight back and look the way I did before.

Also I felt like I wasn't building muscle and I had a sense that the workout I was doing was sometimes decreasing muscle mass.

As I came to the realization that I hit a plateau, a personal trainer at the gym I was going to saw me working out on my own and approached me about doing a complementary personal training session.

I was eager to work with a personal trainer because I was not able to figure out how to overcome this plateau. We had a very strength-building oriented personal training session. At the end of the session, we reviewed my goals and the trainer gave me his theory of why I was not able to cut more body fat and get toned abs no matter how much more I trained and dieted.

He gave me the following tidbits:

1. Drink more water
2. Work out less
3. Eat more

The first point is obvious - water is needed to support metabolic functions. But working out less and eating more to lose weight is a bit counter-intuitive. It made sense after he explained that because I was entering another phase of my fitness journey, the goal is no longer to lose weight but rather to build muscle and lose body fat. Because muscle is more dense than fat, you may see an increase in your body weight as you get more toned.

Muscle is metabolically active and takes much more energy for your body to maintain than fat. In other words, the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism.

There are many reasons to want to have a higher metabolism. From a fitness standpoint, having a high metabolism means you can eat more food without gaining weight.

TODO: ![flowchart of how food, muscle, and metabolism are related]()

Muscle is not built during the exercise but [during periods of rest](TODO: source?).

I had a few fantastic workout sessions with my first personal trainer. We primarily worked on pure strength training like using the squat rack and kettle bells. This supplemented the cardio and anerobic I got from HIIT and running.

Then everything went into lock-down due to COVID.

## Pandemic Lock-down Weight

I felt I was on a good path to getting a six pack but when the lock-down happened, it became less of a priority.

The gyms were closed but the public exercising spaces were still open.

From April to July, I would go out for long runs every other day and do self body-weight exercises at the track.

![picture of me doing the bridge run]()

As far as dieting, I was not as strict with what I was eating but I was still eating a reasonable portion for my three meals everyday.

My weight kept going down although I was eating more and exercising less. As my weight dropped, I was noticing the definition in my abs disappearing.

I was becoming skinny fat.

## Chapter 2: Getting A Six Pack

Gym re-opened 🎉.

Tidbits

- Do cardio after resistance training so you don’t lose the lean muscle
- After resistance training, eat a piece of chicken that’s the size of your fist
- Have amino (liquid or pill form) to prevent loss of muscle from dieting. Amino acid to get definition after the workout (Amino powder is better than pill because the Kidney has to work more to break down the pill. Powder goes directly into your muscle). Then take a 100 grams of chicken. Size of my palm.
- Swimming causes your body to naturally retain a layer of fat

Pitfalls:

- The cause of plateau: not eating enough. No matter how much more you work out, not losing weight because your body is trying to hold on to all the fat and water it has
- Not enough fiber in your diet

### Diet

- **Breakfast**: Eat food that helps with digestion, like Oatmeal and yoghurt. Have yogurt with flax seed in it for the fiber and antioxidant. Yoghurt good for your digestion. (Kite hill - very good dairy free yogurt). Alternatively one or two hard boiled eggs in the morning.
- Lunch / Dinner: 1 fist of chickpea rice. 2 fists of veggies, 1.5 fists of chicken breast. On sprinting days, eat 1 whole chicken breast
- Stay away from processed foods. Processed food causes inflammation. Inflammation causes you to hold on to fat.
- Lower your sodium intake. Sodium makes you bloated
- Watch out for sugar, which makes you store fat
- Eat a salad before a cheat meal. Fiber helps you digest better.
- Drink 3 liters of regular water every day - water boosts metabolism (no seltzer water)
- no carbs after 4pm (if you are strict)

-

Eat bland unprocessed food → no more craving. only crave water and plain chicken breast and fiber

Chickpea rice

IMO, any diet that causes rapid weight loss is dangerous

Rules of thumb:

- Stop eating when you’re full
- You should sleep more hours than you spend exercising (7 hours of sleep)
- Drink 3 liters of water
- Eat 3 fist fulls of protein everyday (3 chicken breasts)

Fast Carbs, Slow Carbs. TODO: quote from book
Steel Cut Oats
Juice lacks the fiber of the fruit’s flesh to help slow digestion and prevent insulin spikes
Nutrients abs healthy fats from salmon helps you feel full

### Tailor Workout for Your Goal

How to get cut

- Do sprinting workouts. Sprinting makes you lose fat very quickly.

### Routine

1. Establish clear measurable objective goals with deadlines that you can track progress on. What’s the definition of done? Set realistic goals (consult experts if your goal can be achieved, e.g., rock climbing), ask smart it’s. Manage burnout, injury, and mitigate risk of failure
2. Rule of thumb and non-negotiable (muscle memory)
3. Singleminded focus. Everything else get deprioritized until this gets done

## Chapter 3: Athlete Mode

### Diet and Nutrition

#### Supplements

Amino and Electrolyte

#### Electrolyte

- Nuun Sport Hydration Tablet
- Don't drink Gatorade - too much sugar
- Natural electrolytes found in coconut, banana, and watermelon

Deadline: August 1, 2021

Goal: 6 pack

#### Cutting Alcohol

### Do I Really Want to Lose More Weight?

### Burnout management

Is it ok to work out 3 times a day?

[https://www.simplesolutionsfitness.com/why-you-should-not-workout-like-an-athlete](https://www.simplesolutionsfitness.com/why-you-should-not-workout-like-an-athlete)

- Healthy exercise is really about finding the balance that works for you. The best fitness plan is one you can stick to. You may work out three times a day, but keep the workouts relatively brief and moderately intense. Three very intense workouts a day is generally too much and can lead to a host of health problems.

My strategy is to **prioritize recovery**.

If you asked me to give you three facts about myself, I would tell you (1) I'm a evening and weekend entrepreneur, (2) when I start working on something I enjoy, I can't put it down, and (3) I love coffee. This a formula for disaster because I have a full time job that I have to show up to by 9AM and I'm a normal human person who needs at least 6 hours of sleep.

# Gamified

there were exercises like renegade row I couldn’t do before because I didn’t have the core strength. then I worked on getting stronger core and now I can do renegade rows. Leveled up my skill and new group of exercises unlocked

I’m currently working on unlocking inversions in yoga (e.g., head stands). I need stronger shoulder and upper back and lower abs muscles

my motivation for eating clean and not drinking is so I don’t gain excess weight like fat that’s not going to help me with doing yoga poses or rock climbing. The more weight you are, the more muscle you need to support yourself

that's a really fun way of modeling your progress

Types of workouts

- Calisthenics - use your own body weight
- isometric movement - lifting one side of your body so you're balancing
- Barre - small movements with low amount of weight for lots of repetition
- plyometrics- star jumps, burpees with a high jump

Barre and Pilates for toning
HIIT for cutting (always do fasted HIIT)
Rock climbing - functional strength training and core
Low impact lengthening workouts like pilates

# Research

[https://www.livestrong.com/article/334233-how-females-get-six-pack-abs/](https://www.livestrong.com/article/334233-how-females-get-six-pack-abs/)

- The average woman has a body fat percentage [between 25 and 31 percent](https://www.builtlean.com/ideal-body-fat-percentage-chart/). To start to see abs, body fat needs to be 20 percent or lower, according to fitness and fat loss expert Michael Matthews. At this point, the layer of fat between your skin and muscle is thin enough that you can start to see muscle definition in the abdomen.
- **Vigorous exercise > long slow cardio:**
  - Maybe you hear that long, slow cardio is best for fat loss. That's a myth. Besides burning more calories, intense exercise has other benefits for fat loss.
  - Due to something called "excess post-exercise oxygen consumption," or EPOC, intense exercise boosts your metabolism after you finish your workout. According to well-known health and fitness expert, [Pete McCall,](https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/professional/expert-articles/5008/7-things-to-know-about-excess-post-exercise-oxygen-consumption-epoc) your body works hard after a tough exercise session to bring itself back to its pre-exercise state. This takes energy, so it burns calories. That means you continue to burn calories after your workout is finished for as long as it takes your body to come back to baseline.
  - The most effective exercise for increasing the EPOC effect, says McCall, is high-intensity interval training, or **HIIT**. During a HIIT workout, you alternate periods of very intense effort with periods of active recovery at a slower pace. These spurts of intense effort mean your body has to do more work in the period following exercise to bring the body back into homeostasis.
  - HIIT also may be more effective at burning abdominal fat, specifically. A study published in Diabetes & Metabolism in 2016 found that women who completed a HIIT cycling workout two days a week for 16 weeks lost more abdominal fat than women who did an equivalent moderate-intensity steady-state training program. The researchers concluded that HIIT appears to be more effective than steady-state cardio for reducing abdominal fat.
- Building muscle
  - Burning fat is about eating less, exercising more and optimizing your metabolism. The best way to get abs as a female is to build more total-body lean muscle mass. The more lean muscle mass you have, the more energy your body expends building and maintaining it.
  - While fat takes very little energy to maintain, muscle is metabolically active and accounts for up to 20 percent of your total daily energy expenditure
    The best moves for getting six-pack abs include:
  - Squats
  - Lunges
  - Dead lifts
  - Chest press
  - Pullups
  - Rows
  - Military press

[https://www.builtlean.com/ideal-body-fat-percentage-chart/](https://www.builtlean.com/ideal-body-fat-percentage-chart/)

Digging a little deeper, there are 3 types of fat: subcutaneous (under the skin), visceral (around the organs), and intramuscular (in between muscle, like a marbled steak). The amount of subcutaneous body fat you have may stay the same, but the visceral and intramuscular fat may increase as you age.

[https://www.livestrong.com/article/170144-how-to-get-a-six-pack-fast-for-girls/](https://www.livestrong.com/article/170144-how-to-get-a-six-pack-fast-for-girls/)

To lose a pound of fat a week, you will need to burn off roughly 3,500 calories a week or 500 calories per day says Harvard Health Publishing.

Steps

1. Caloric restriction
2. Tone abdominals with planking exercises
3. Tone obliques by doing side planks. Obliquesgive your abs a sculted look
4. Cardio: Aim to do five cardio sessions of 60 minutes each for a total of about 300 minutes per week at a moderate pace. Two of those sessions should include high-intensity intervals done at a vigorous pace, to increase caloric burn both during and hours after exercise.

[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-protein-can-help-you-lose-weight](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-protein-can-help-you-lose-weight)

What to eat:

- protein help you lose weight naturally
- Protein Reduces Appetite and Makes You Eat Fewer Calories
- Protein Makes You Lose Weight, Even Without Conscious Calorie Restriction
- Fiber reduces bloating. When you start increasing fiber in your diet, you must drink more water too, because soluble fiber holds onto water—otherwise you can end up constipated. Aim for two to three liters of water daily. Sodium and potassium are electrolytes in charge of water balance in our body. Sodium causes retention of water and potassium flushes out extra water helping you achieve a flatter and bloat-free stomach. most fruit and veggies are high in potassium.

How much to eat

- Make sure you eat a high protein diet and stop eating when full.

## Exercises

### Goal Setting

Identify your goal. My goal is to get faster at running and be stronger for rock climbing. Set clear and measurable goals and deadlines.

- Q2 Goal: 8 min mile pace
- Q3 Goal: 7 min mile pace
- Q4 Goal: 6 min mile pace

- If you have knee problem, do reverse lunge first
- Use big muscle and compound movements. That burns more calories (HIIT)
- Small muscle movements is for toning (Pilates and Barre)
- For harder lunges, hold two heavy weights close to your body. Pull your shoulder back (make sure the elbows are close to the torso). This works the back muscle.
- HIIT exercises
  - Strenth
    - Pendulum lunge - back lunge then front lunge without touching the ground. Two on each side.
    - Start on the Knees, get into a squat, then shoulder press from the squat position, get back into squat, get back on the knees
  - Plyometric
    - Skater hop, don’t let the back foot touch
    - Alternating mountain climber and plank jack
    - Reverse lunge, touch the floor, explosive jump
    - squat, explosive jump up, high knees four times
    - star jump
- Good stretch for hop and shoulder mobility
  - reverse table top, shift your hip toward your hands, straighten out the knees. Then move your hip up
  - Frog plank
- Full-body core exercises
  - Renegade rows
  - TRX pike
  - Side plank with hip lift
  - Plank, shoulder touch each side, ankle touch each side

### EPOC (the secret to losing fat)

[https://dailyburn.com/life/fitness/epoc-afterburn-effect/](https://dailyburn.com/life/fitness/epoc-afterburn-effect/)

- Favor HIIT over steady state cardio

### Types of Workouts

- HIIT (Tabata, sprinting, METCON3) - big movements with heavy weights. burns fat and modifies body composition.
  - How you should feel: elevated heart rate. strength training
  - HIIT is the only cardio I do.
- Barre and Pilates - small movements (pulsing) with body weight or light weights is good for toning your body to get the sculpted look and to build strength in the stabilizing muscles and tendons to prevent injuries when you do the high intensity workouts and strength training
  - How you should feel: burning
- Yoga and Swimming - stability, stretching, and recovery.
- Foam rolling - full recovery
- Pure strength training - If you want to bulk up those big muscles, then pull-ups on your own and using the squat rack get the job done

## Sprained Ankle Workout

- sitting. Alternating Lateral raise side way, lateral raise front. 10lbs. Then flutter kick.
- Tie the rubber band to bottom of machine, do elbow to knee touch. Then shoulder press
- On your knees, hold on to rubber band, another person walks around you. Try to not move
- Use the cardio machines (HIIT bike and skierG for cardio)

# Weight / Progress

# Routine

1. Establish clear measurable objective goals with deadlines that you can track progress on. What’s the definition of done? Set realistic goals (consult experts if your goal can be achieved, e.g., rock climbing), ask smart it’s. Manage burnout, injury, and mitigate risk of failure
2. Rule of thumb and non-negotiable (muscle memory)
3. Singleminded focus. Everything else get deprioritized until this gets done

# Sustainability

I was talking to a friend of mine about what sparks joy for us. He said building software is more rewarding than working out because it's very easy to lose the gains from working out but software lives forever. That's a very interesting perspective.

I’ve always enjoyed sandbox open world games more than any other types of games. I like having a safe environment to explore the boundaries of my limits and push beyond those limits.

### Conclusion

1. Join a fitness group chat. Social accountability.
2. Get a smartscale that tracks your progress automatically
3. Establish a routine - so you don't even have to think about it
4. Deadline and milestones
5. Rules of thumb and non-negotiables
