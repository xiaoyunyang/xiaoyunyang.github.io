When I was planning my trip to Japan with some friends, I thought why not to use this opportunity to make a ReactNative mobile app to help you plan and execute your travel itinerary.

ReactNative is a game changer.

It makes the barrier of entry low to make a cross-platform mobile app. The hallmark of Mobile Travel App I made (see [react-native-travel-app](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/react-native-travel-app) repo) is that it took full advantage of the ReactNative open source ecosystem. There is a component for everything you need.

Often times in the javascript ecosystem, you are dealing with a lot of little libraries and you are bringing them together to form a framework that makes sense for your application. So it’s helpful to know what all these little libraries do. Many of them are very simple. But at the end of the day, it’s your job as the developer working in this ecosystem to mix and match them and put them in a composable fashion that makes sense for the application that you are trying to build.
