An article entitled [Why Managers Should Care about Employee Loyalty](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-managers-should-care-employee-loyalty-brigette-hyacinth/) was posted on LinkedIn and here's why I think employee loyalty is beneficial for neither the employee nor the employer.

The article sets the stage with this statement:

{{< blockquote "Brigette Hyacinth" "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-managers-should-care-employee-loyalty-brigette-hyacinth/" "Why Managers Should Care About Employee Loyalty" >}} Loyal employees are a major asset for a strong company. {{< /blockquote >}}

I disagree with the premise of the argument that employee loyalty is something to be desired and can/should be controlled.

# Everyone Leaves Eventually
The notion that employees are motivated by carrots and sticks may have some basis in the industrial age when everyone works in a factory, the driver of today's economy is an educated, self-motivated, and creative workforce who are not motivated by carrots and sticks. Even if someone is loyal to the company, it doesn't mean they won't leave. Everyone leaves eventually either taking on to other opportunities, trying out something new in their lives, or going into retirement. Also employee loyalty detrimental to the employees because it instills the false belief that the employer is watching out for their interest and they can count on a stable job. In this age of globalism, rapid innovation, and automation, your job could be gone the next few years due to forces outside of your, your manager's, or even company's control. Entire industries can be made obsolete in a decade. Look at what's happening to the coal miners and workers at coal power plants who were counting on that being their forever job and now only coming to the realization that they need to learn a different skill to make a living.

# Status Quo and Innovation
Staying at a forever job is not going to motivate people to update their skills on their own to be relevant and competitive in the labor market. It's also expensive and ineffective for employers to pay for their employees to update their skills. When your employees plateau and stagnate because they have learned everything they need to do the job that they were hired to do, your company is going to plateau and stagnate. The mantra today is to innovate or die. This is how many technology giants in the 20th century went out of business.

# Don't Change Them. Change Yourself.
Instead of working on retaining employees, companies should redesign their business models, internal processes, and hiring philosophies to withstand and even thrive with a high turnover workforce. The most profitable and innovative companies in the world have stopped fighting people from leaving the company and have embraced that this is the reality today and probably for the best because freedom of mobility, flexibility, and change is an important driver of human happiness and growth. Having a high turnover rate could be beneficial because new people bring new ideas and challenge the status quo.

It's unfortunate that some jobs consist of almost entirely maintaining the status quo (work on legacy systems), making slow and incremental improvements over a long period of time, and rely on antiquated processes and tribal knowledge. You are going to have to figure out how to still function after losing those "village elders" due to retirements. But you don't see many of these companies around in the private sector. They are still prevalent in the public sector but I think people who voluntarily work in the public sector - many are coerced but that's a different story - work there for a different reason than personal enjoyment, purpose, and growth so they probably won't just quit over an argument with a manager.

## Bottomline:

Instead of focusing on building employee loyalty, we should should work toward these goals

* Employee happiness - If they are happy, they are more likely to stick around. Word will get out that your company is a fun place to work and you will see more top talents applying to work at your company.
* Resiliency - Your company needs to be able to deal with loss of talent and prepare for these contingencies. It's unlikely you'll survive after a mass exodus of all your talent but losing one or two really experienced people should not put you out of business.
