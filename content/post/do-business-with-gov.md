The System for Award Management (SAM) is the primary registrant database for entities to do business with the U.S. Government. You must register with SAM before [applying for a seed fund from the government](/post/getting-started-with-startup-seed-funding/) for your startup.

# SAM Registration

Guides:

* [SAM User Guide](https://www.sam.gov/sam/SAM_Guide/SAM_User_Guide.htm).
* [How to Complete SAM Registration](https://missouribusiness.net/article/how-to-complete-sam-registration/)

Steps for System for Award Management (SAM) Registrations:

1. Go to [www.sam.gov](www.sam.gov).
2. Create a Personal Account and Login.
3. Click Â“Register New EntityÂ” under Â“Register/Update EntityÂ” on your Â“My SAMÂ” page.
4. Review Registration Overview and click Â“Start RegistrationÂ”
5. Select the type of Entity (typically Â“Business or OrganizationÂ”)
6. Select Â“YesÂ” for Â“Do you wish to bid on contracts? Then Click Â“NextÂ”
7. Confirm Purpose and Click Â“NextÂ”
8. Complete Â“Core DataÂ” as follows:
  * a. Validate your DUNS information.
  * b. Enter Business Information (TIN and so on).
  * c. Enter the CAGE code if you have one. If not, one will be assigned to you after your registration is completed. Foreign registrants must enter an NCAGE code.
  * d. Enter General Information (business types, organization structure, etc.).
  * e. Financial Information (Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Information).
  * f. Executive Compensation.
  * g. Proceedings Details.
9. Complete Â“AssertionsÂ” as follows:
    * a. Goods and Services (NAICS, PSC, etc.). NAICS is required. PSC is optional.
      * **NAIC:** North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes are a method for classifying business establishments. You must select at least one NAICS Code indicating the industry in which you offer goods or services before your registration can be complete. If you do not know the NAICS Code(s) for your industry, search http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/. You can add or change NAICS Codes at any time. The NAICS Codes you enter here will be used by the government for market research.
      * **PSC:** Product Service Codes (PSC) are optional, four-character, and alpha-numeric codes used to identify the products and/or services your entity provides. Federal Supply Codes (FSCs) are a subset of the PSCs. You may search for PSC Codes [here](https://www.acquisition.gov/PSC%20Manual%20-%20Final%20-%2011%20August%202011.pdf)
      * [Facebook's](https://siccode.com/en/business/facebook-inc-menlo-park-94025) NAICS Code is 518210 for Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services and SIC Code is 7374 for Computer Processing and Data Preparation and Processing Services.
      * [LinkedIn's NAICS Code](https://siccode.com/en/business/linkedin-chicago-60661) is 541511 for Custom Computer Programming Services.
      * [Github's NAICS Code](https://siccode.com/en/business/github-inc-san-francisco-94107) is 541511 as well.

        Since I think LooseLeaf is like LinkedIn meets Github, I selected NAICS Code *541511*. I didn't select a PSC.

    * b. Size Metrics.

        You need to fill out how much money you made since incorporating the company (average over the last x years since incorporation) and how many employees you have, including yourself.

        > Total Receipts means "total income" (or in the case of a sole proprietorship, "gross income") plus "cost of goods sold" as these terms are defined and reported on Internal Revenue Service tax return forms. Receipts are averaged over a concern's latest three (3) completed fiscal years to determine its average annual receipts.

        It won't let you enter $0, so I entered $1 and it went through. ðŸ˜•
    * c. EDI Information: This asks if you want to provide your Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) information.
        * Click No
    * d. Disaster Relief Information:
        * Click No.

See [instruction for domestic entities](https://fsd.gov/fsd-gov/answer.do?sysparm_kbid=d2e67885db0d5f00b3257d321f96194b&sysparm_search=kb0013183)

# Pro-Tip

You may get an error from SAM when everything is ready to go and you press the "final Submit" button.

> Mandatory Errors. SBA Supplemental Page was not available due to the following error: SAM did not receive a URL from SBA.

I followed [this tutorial](https://govology.com/updating-sba-profile-easy-way/) to request/create an account with SBA's General Login System at  https://eweb.sba.gov/gls/dsp_login.cfm. I created a profile and logged in with my username and password. Then clicked on "Profile" from the menu and added a new business. You just have to enter DUNS and EIN. Then I went back to SAM and tried to submit again. It went through. I don't know if it was an intermittent error with SAM or that step was necessary.

# After Submitting

SAM will send your application to the IRS for validation of your Taxpayer Identification Number (or EIN) and Taxpayer Name. This could take two business days. Then SAM will send your application to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code system for assigning you a new CAGE Code. You'll get an email from sam.gov once your registration passes these external validations and becomes active.
