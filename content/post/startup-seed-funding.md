# What is NSF Seed Fund
The NSF Seed Fund is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) initiative which provides seed funding for startups that work on innovations with promise of commercial and societal impact. NSF Seed Fund accepts proposals in almost any area of science and technology. NSF Seed Fund is a grant so they take no equity in your company.

As discussed in [this article](http://www.davidcrobinson.com/2015/09/05/part-2-the-rocky-relationship-of-sbir-with-venture-capital/), the NSF Seed Fund offers an effective way for small companies to de-risk technologies that are often too early for venture or even angel investing.


## Criteria for Success

There are [three criteria](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/resources/review/peer-review/) for a successful applicant:

1. **Intellectual Merit** - the potential to advance knowledge. Metrics for this criterion include the extent in which the proposed activities explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts.
2. **Broader Impacts** - the potential to benefit society. Metrics include the means to assess desired societal impact.
3. **Commercial Impact**, which encompasses the potential to lead to significant outcomes in the commercial market. Metrics for this criterion include a compelling potential business model, whether the company possessing a significant and durable competitive advantage over competitors based on technical innovation, and whether there exists a significant market opportunity that could be addressed by the proposed product.

For every criterion, the team's qualification would be factored into the assessment to justify the investment. A successful team has the expertise, structure, experience, and resources available in-house or through collaboration to carry out the proposed activities and achieve a successful outcome.

One tip to [improve your chances of success](http://www.davidcrobinson.com/2015/09/05/part-3-how-to-improve-your-chances-of-success-when-applying-for-an-sbirsttr/) for the NSF Seed Fund is to make sure you meet all the prerequisites for applying. This includes getting a business license, a DUNS number, register with the government System for Award Management (SAM). Once you've completed the pre-requisites, you are ready to register with the agency that you think might fund your technology or company. For LooseLeaf, this would be either:

* Educational Technologies and Applications (EA) - See [EA Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio/#educational-technologies-and-applications-ea).
* Information Technologies (IT), or Other Topics (OT) - See [See IT Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/topics/information-technologies/).

See [current Phase I awardees](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/awardees/phase-1/) to get a flavor of what kind of startups win NSF Seed Fund.

# Instruction

Read the [SBIR solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18550/nsf18550.htm) and the [STTR solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18551/nsf18551.htm) includes everything you need to know about applying for funding.

Per the [SBIR Solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18550/nsf18550.htm), successful applicants to the Phase I seed fund will receive a grant up to $225K over a period of 6 to 12 months.

**Timeline**

* **5PM on June 14, 2018** is the deadline for the full application.
* 1-3 months after the deadline, panel and merit review will be performed.
* 4-6 months after the deadline, you'll be Notified on whether your proposal is accepted or declined.
* 5-6 months after the deadline, you'll receive funding of up to $225K if your proposal is accepted.

# Pre-requisites

1. Incorporate your startup as a LLC, C-Corp, or S-Corp. I used LegalZoom to incorporate LooseLeaf as a single-entity LLC.
2. Once you obtain documentation to verify your company's existence, you can obtain a DUNS number. I called the number listed on the [Dun & Bradstreet's website](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html) to have them email me a link to submit copies of the business documentation. I submitted a Certificate of Organization and EIN Confirmation and Application.
3. You have to wait a few days for the DUNS number to get entered into the system. Once that happens, you can start your SAM registration.
4. Register your company with the SBIR. See https://www.sbir.gov/registration/
4. Once you completed completed your SAM registration, you can begin entering your proposal in FastLane.

## SAM Registration

The System for Award Management (SAM) is the primary registrant database for entities to do business with the U.S. Government. This SAM registration must be maintained with current information at all times during which the organization has an active award or a proposal under consideration by NSF. See the [step-by-step](/post/getting-started-with-sam-application/) for how I completed the SAM Application for LooseLeaf.

## SBA Company Registration
Receipt of a Small Business Concern identification number (SBC ID) is required prior to submission of the proposal. SBA maintains and manages a Company Registry for SBIR/STTR applicants at https://www.sbir.gov/registration/ to track ownership and affiliation requirements. All SBCs must report and/or update ownership information to SBA prior to each SBIR/STTR application submission or if any information changes prior to award. Please see the SBA registration documentation section of the Proposal Submission Instructions.

## Pre-Submittal Feedback (Optional)

You fill out a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyZt4vfPc35A4wvbqTANPs11c1KraMq4_bc6hX8jKV307axw/viewform?c=0&w=1) where you need to answer a few questions about your business:

**1. Briefly describe the company and team:**

* LooseLeaf is a platform which provides hands-on training opportunities for people looking to close skills gaps and make a career change. LooseLeaf's team consists of one passionate software engineer.

**2. Describe the market opportunity, value proposition, and customers (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words):**

* LooseLeaf provides a platform to help people who are looking for opportunities to close skills gaps and obtain relevant work experience complete assignments for non-profits who desperately need volunteers to make a website, create marketing material, and contribute to their blogs. LooseLeaf’s potential users are college students, recent college graduates who are unemployed or underemployed as well as those who are looking for a career transition.
* LooseLeaf’s customers are the non-profits. Many non-profits lack a tech-savvy staff, a marketing department, or funds to work with contractors and freelancers that would provide the best outcome. LooseLeaf’s assignment creation tool assists non-profits in creating an assignment for the developers, graphic designers, and writers that can clearly articulate what kind of website, marketing content, or blog article they want to be created. Another group of customers are partners who sell educational products and tools targeted at assisting the users in completing their assignments for the non-profits.

**3. Describe the technology/innovation (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**4. Describe the technical challenges to overcome (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**5. Describe the competition (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**6. In which topic area does the technology best fit?**

* Educational Technologies and Applications (EA) - See EA [Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio/#educational-technologies-and-applications-ea).
* Information Technologies (IT), or Other Topics (OT) - See [See IT Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/topics/information-technologies/).
