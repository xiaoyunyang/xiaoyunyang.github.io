You need to answer three questions:

**Briefly describe the company and team**
LooseLeaf provide opportunities for people looking to close skills gaps and make a career change. LooseLeaf's team consists of one software engineer and a math teacher.

**Describe the market opportunity, value proposition, and customers (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

LooseLeaf provides a platform to help people who are looking for opportunities to close skills gaps and obtain relevant work experience complete assignments for non-profits who desperately need volunteers to make a website, create marketing material, and contribute to their blogs. LooseLeaf’s potential users are college students, recent college graduates who are unemployed or underemployed as well as those who are looking for a career transition.

LooseLeaf’s customers are the non-profits. Many non-profits lack a tech-savvy staff, a marketing department, or funds to work with contractors and freelancers that would provide the best outcome. LooseLeaf’s assignment creation tool assists non-profits in creating an assignment for the developers, graphic designers, and writers that can clearly articulate what kind of website, marketing content, or blog article they want to be created. Another group of customers are partners who sell educational products and tools targeted at assisting the users in completing their assignments for the non-profits.

**Describe the technology/innovation (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**Describe the technical challenges to overcome (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**Describe the competition (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**In which topic area does the technology best fit?**

* Educational Technologies and Applications (EA), Information Technologies (IT), or Other Topics (OT).
