# What is NSF Seed Fund
The NSF SBIR program seeks innovative proposals that show promise of commercial and societal impact. We invite the submission of proposals in almost any area of science and technology. NSF Seed Fund is a grant. They take no equity in your company.

As discussed in [this article](http://www.davidcrobinson.com/2015/09/05/part-2-the-rocky-relationship-of-sbir-with-venture-capital/), the NSF Seed Fund offers an effective way for small companies to de-risk technologies that are often too early for venture or even angel investing.


## Criteria for Success

There are [three criteria](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/resources/review/peer-review/) for a successful applicant:

1. **Intellectual Merit** - the potential to advance knowledge. Metrics for this criterion include the extent in which the proposed activities explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts.
2. **Broader Impacts** - the potential to benefit society. Metrics include the means to assess desired societal impact.
3. **Commercial Impact**, which encompasses the potential to lead to significant outcomes in the commercial market. Metrics for this criterion include a compelling potential business model, whether the company possessing a significant and durable competitive advantage over competitors based on technical innovation, and whether there exists a significant market opportunity that could be addressed by the proposed product.

For every criterion, the team's qualification would be factored into the assessment to justify the investment. A successful team has the expertise, structure, experience, and resources available in-house or through collaboration to carry out the proposed activities and achieve a successful outcome.

One tip to [improve your chances of success](http://www.davidcrobinson.com/2015/09/05/part-3-how-to-improve-your-chances-of-success-when-applying-for-an-sbirsttr/) for the NSF Seed Fund is to make sure you meet all the prerequisites for applying. This includes getting a business license, a DUNS number, register with the government System for Award Management (SAM). Once you've completed the pre-requisites, you are ready to register with the agency that you think might fund your technology or company. For LooseLeaf, this would be either:

* Educational Technologies and Applications (EA) - See EA [Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio/#educational-technologies-and-applications-ea).
* Information Technologies (IT), or Other Topics (OT) - See [See IT Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/topics/information-technologies/).

See [current Phase I awardees](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/awardees/phase-1/) to get a flavor of what kind of startups win NSF Seed Fund.

## Pre-Submittal Feedback (Optional)

You fill out a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyZt4vfPc35A4wvbqTANPs11c1KraMq4_bc6hX8jKV307axw/viewform?c=0&w=1) where you need to answer a few questions about your business:

**1. Briefly describe the company and team:**

* LooseLeaf provide opportunities for people looking to close skills gaps and make a career change. LooseLeaf's team consists of one software engineer and a math teacher.

**2. Describe the market opportunity, value proposition, and customers (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words):**

* LooseLeaf provides a platform to help people who are looking for opportunities to close skills gaps and obtain relevant work experience complete assignments for non-profits who desperately need volunteers to make a website, create marketing material, and contribute to their blogs. LooseLeaf’s potential users are college students, recent college graduates who are unemployed or underemployed as well as those who are looking for a career transition.
* LooseLeaf’s customers are the non-profits. Many non-profits lack a tech-savvy staff, a marketing department, or funds to work with contractors and freelancers that would provide the best outcome. LooseLeaf’s assignment creation tool assists non-profits in creating an assignment for the developers, graphic designers, and writers that can clearly articulate what kind of website, marketing content, or blog article they want to be created. Another group of customers are partners who sell educational products and tools targeted at assisting the users in completing their assignments for the non-profits.

**3. Describe the technology/innovation (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**4. Describe the technical challenges to overcome (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**5. Describe the competition (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**6. In which topic area does the technology best fit?**

* Educational Technologies and Applications (EA) - See EA [Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio/#educational-technologies-and-applications-ea).
