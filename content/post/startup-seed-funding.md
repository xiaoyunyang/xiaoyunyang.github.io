# What is NSF Seed Fund
The NSF Seed Fund is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) initiative which provides seed funding for startups that work on innovations with promise of commercial and societal impact. NSF Seed Fund accepts proposals in almost any area of science and technology. NSF Seed Fund is a grant so they take no equity in your company.

As discussed in [this article](http://www.davidcrobinson.com/2015/09/05/part-2-the-rocky-relationship-of-sbir-with-venture-capital/), the NSF Seed Fund offers an effective way for small companies to de-risk technologies that are often too early for venture or even angel investing.


## Criteria for Success

There are [three criteria](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/resources/review/peer-review/) for a successful applicant:

1. **Intellectual Merit** - the potential to advance knowledge. Metrics for this criterion include the extent in which the proposed activities explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts.
2. **Broader Impacts** - the potential to benefit society. Metrics include the means to assess desired societal impact.
3. **Commercial Impact**, which encompasses the potential to lead to significant outcomes in the commercial market. Metrics for this criterion include a compelling potential business model, whether the company possessing a significant and durable competitive advantage over competitors based on technical innovation, and whether there exists a significant market opportunity that could be addressed by the proposed product.

For every criterion, the team's qualification would be factored into the assessment to justify the investment. A successful team has the expertise, structure, experience, and resources available in-house or through collaboration to carry out the proposed activities and achieve a successful outcome.

One tip to [improve your chances of success](http://www.davidcrobinson.com/2015/09/05/part-3-how-to-improve-your-chances-of-success-when-applying-for-an-sbirsttr/) for the NSF Seed Fund is to make sure you meet all the prerequisites for applying. This includes getting a business license, a DUNS number, register with the government System for Award Management (SAM). Once you've completed the pre-requisites, you are ready to register with the agency that you think might fund your technology or company. For LooseLeaf, this would be either:

* Educational Technologies and Applications (EA) - See [EA Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio/#educational-technologies-and-applications-ea).
* Information Technologies (IT), or Other Topics (OT) - See [See IT Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/topics/information-technologies/).

See [current Phase I awardees](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/awardees/phase-1/) to get a flavor of what kind of startups win NSF Seed Fund.

# Instruction

Read the [SBIR solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18550/nsf18550.htm) and the [STTR solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18551/nsf18551.htm) includes everything you need to know about applying for funding.

Per the [SBIR Solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18550/nsf18550.htm), successful applicants to the Phase I seed fund will receive a grant up to $225K over a period of 6 to 12 months.

**Timeline**

* **5PM on June 14, 2018** is the deadline for the full application.
* 1-3 months after the deadline, panel and merit review will be performed.
* 4-6 months after the deadline, you'll be Notified on whether your proposal is accepted or declined.
* 5-6 months after the deadline, you'll receive funding of up to $225K if your proposal is accepted.

# Pre-requisites

1. Incorporate your startup as a LLC, C-Corp, or S-Corp. I used LegalZoom to incorporate LooseLeaf as a single-entity LLC.
2. Once you obtain documentation to verify your company's existence, you can obtain a DUNS number. I called the number listed on the [Dun & Bradstreet's website](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html) to have them email me a link to submit copies of the business documentation. I submitted a Certificate of Organization and EIN Confirmation and Application.
3. You have to wait a few days for the DUNS number to get entered into the system. Once that happens, you can start your SAM registration.
4. Register your company with the SBIR. See https://www.sbir.gov/registration/
4. Once you completed completed your SAM registration, you can begin entering your proposal in FastLane.

## SAM Registration

The System for Award Management (SAM) is the primary registrant database for entities to do business with the U.S. Government. This SAM registration must be maintained with current information at all times during which the organization has an active award or a proposal under consideration by NSF. See the [step-by-step](/post/getting-started-with-sam-application/) for how I completed the SAM Application for LooseLeaf.

## SBA Company Registration
Receipt of a Small Business Concern identification number (SBC ID) is required prior to submission of the proposal. SBA maintains and manages a Company Registry for SBIR/STTR applicants at https://www.sbir.gov/registration/ to track ownership and affiliation requirements. All SBCs must report and/or update ownership information to SBA prior to each SBIR/STTR application submission or if any information changes prior to award. Please see the SBA registration documentation section of the Proposal Submission Instructions.

## Pre-Submittal Feedback (Optional)

You fill out a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyZt4vfPc35A4wvbqTANPs11c1KraMq4_bc6hX8jKV307axw/viewform?c=0&w=1) where you need to answer a few questions about your business:

**1. Briefly describe the company and team:**

* LooseLeaf is a platform which provides hands-on training opportunities for people looking to close skills gaps and make a career change. LooseLeaf is a single-member LLC consisting of one passionate software engineer who started LooseLeaf while serving in the Navy.

**2. Describe the market opportunity, value proposition, and customers (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words):**

* LooseLeaf provides a platform to help people who are looking for opportunities to close skills gaps and obtain relevant work experience complete assignments for non-profits who desperately need volunteers to make a website, create marketing material, and contribute to their blogs. LooseLeaf’s potential users are college students, recent college graduates who are unemployed or underemployed as well as those who are looking for a career transition.
* LooseLeaf’s customers are the non-profits. Many non-profits lack a tech-savvy staff, a marketing department, or funds to work with contractors and freelancers that would provide the best outcome. LooseLeaf’s assignment creation tool assists non-profits in creating an assignment for the developers, graphic designers, and writers that can clearly articulate what kind of website, marketing content, or blog article they want to be created. Another group of customers are partners who sell educational products and tools targeted at assisting the users in completing their assignments for the non-profits.

**3. Describe the technology/innovation (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**4. Describe the technical challenges to overcome (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**x

**5. Describe the competition (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)**

**6. In which topic area does the technology best fit?**

* Educational Technologies and Applications (EA) - See EA [Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio/#educational-technologies-and-applications-ea).
* Information Technologies (IT), or Other Topics (OT) - See [See IT Categories](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/topics/information-technologies/).

# LooseLeaf Product

{{< image classes="fancybox fig-100 clear" src="/post/images/looseleaf/product-flowchart.png"
thumbnail="/post/images/looseleaf/product-flowchart.png" title="LooseLeaf Product Flowchart">}}

## 1. Job Insights

The first cornerstone for LooseLeaf's product is to demystify the career track by offering new career seekers a preview of the available job opportunities and the type of skills and experience a successful candidate must possess. The best way to get that insight is from **Job boards**.  Job boards are a type of search engine which aggregate and display jobs posted by employers seeking new employees. These job boards often target one specific industry like technology, design. They are among the most popular sites on the Internet.

Based on Betterteam's ranking for [best Job Board](https://www.betterteam.com/job-boards), Indeed, Glassdoor, Craigslist, LinkedIn, Facebook are considered some of the best general job boards. There are some specialized job boards. There are many jobs [specializing in tech jobs](https://careersidekick.com/best-tech-job-boards/)

**TODO:** Investigate each of the job boards below to determine if they have an API for third party developers to access data on jobs.

## 2. Skills, Knowledge, and Portfolio Building

The second cornerstone of LooseLeaf's product is the skills, knowledge, and portfolio building. Based on [the latest coding bootcamp market research](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2017-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research)

> the number of coding bootcamp graduates has **grown 10x** since the first bootcamps launched in 2012. Coding bootcamps are a $260 million industry and will graduate ~23,000 developers in 2017.

There are a few concerns with using a bootcamp to close the skills and experience gap:

1. Cost - Average tuition price of qualifying courses is ~$11,400.
2. Format - An average program length of 14.1 weeks. Bootcamps are trending longer – up from 12.9 weeks in 2016 to add computer science basics to the curriculum. If you never coded in your life, 13 weeks is not going to be enough to be a good software developer. Coding and problem solving skills are like muscle that you need to build up with practice.
3. Exclusivity - There are prep schools for coding bootcamps. You have to be accepted into the bootcamp, like college. Many people are working a full time job, with bills, mortgage, and a family, so they can't drop everything to attend a bootcamp. Also, there're no bootcamps for content creators and designers looking to hone their skills through lots of practice.

We help career-changers try out the careers they want to enter by working on projects for non-profits, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs for free. In exchange, they get feedback from their clients and get a feel for what it's like to work as a developer, designer, or writer.

When you work for free, you're not working for exposure. Freelancers [work for gratitude, shout-outs, and opportunities that this would lead to something else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeVj-ASeGLs). It's often your initiative and may materialize to something down the line.

## 3. Candidate Sourcing

The last cornerstone of LooseLeaf's product is the candidate sourcing, which is a combination of the Recruitment Candidate Relationship Manage System (CRM) and Application Tracking System (ATS).

CRM is used by recruiters and a company's talent sourcing team [to identify strong active and passive candidates](https://blog.beamery.com/ats-vs-crm/) and encourage them to apply to the position.

> **CRM:** Your candidate relationship management system is for job seekers and candidates. It’s the engine that drives your sourcing team, lets you create talent pools and helps you build and nurture relationships with passive talent.

ATS is used by the hiring team to track and automate some of the processes for job applicants to go through each stage of the hiring process. Many employers are [having difficulty](https://www.betterteam.com/applicant-tracking-system) finding candidates or sorting through the vast number of applicants they get.

Many ATS systems offer additional features, such as note taking, bulk emailing, and job posting. ATS works by tracking who has applied for each job, when they applied, and what stages of the hiring process they've gone through and still need to go through. Some ATS also integrates **CV scanner** (i.e., allow CVs to be searched and filtered quickly to filter out candidates), **assessment platform** (e.g., candidate testing platforms, including code testing, video interviewing, personality testing, and more), and **Recruiting CRM** (candidate relationship management system for job seekers, candidates)

There are a [whole plethora of recruiting websites](https://www.betterteam.com/top-job-posting-sites) dedicated to posting jobs, integrating Applicant Tracking Software (ATS), and hiring qualified candidates. Many of them have APIs for the companies posting jobs since they are the customers. Few have APIs for third party developers to acquire data from job postings to inform a talented but not-yet-qualified candidate on what the opportunities are and in what areas they need to build their skills and experience.

* The [SmartRecruiters API](https://dev.smartrecruiters.com/customer-api/posting-api/endpoints/postings/) lets you grab active postings published by given company. Companies posting jobs using SmartRecruiters include Atlassian (See [example](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/Atlassian/743999668426546)).
* Not Friendly to 3rd Party Developers (Yet).

    * [Greenhouse.io API](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html#job-posts) provides Job Posts, which provides online job posts for a particular organization's jobs. I don't think they offer third party developers access to the job postings. Companies using Greenhouse includes Github (See [example](https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1137157#.Wu9pxdPwZZ0)).
    * [Workable API](https://workable.readme.io/docs/jobs). They have an API, but it’s only for paying customers (i.e., employers) to access and manage their own data: https://workable.readme.io/docs/generate-an-access-token) seems to be only for  paying customers (i.e., employers) to access and manage their own data. ActionIQ and Gitbook use workable to post jobs. See example [here](https://actioniq.workable.com/j/610FFCEB61) and [here](https://gitbook.workable.com/j/7F8654B9FD).


> Put simply, your ATS is a workflow and compliance tool that manages applicants, your CRM is an ecosystem of all passive and active candidates, as well as everyone who has previously applied to your company. It’s a **complete talent intelligence hub**.

# Market Opportunity

## The Problem

The [skills gap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLcM4iZSTo) is a major contributor of unemployment and underemployment. Low skilled work opportunities are disappearing, being automated away. Companies are in the business of educating workers. They are not schools and many have few resources to train new hires. New hires are expected to acquire the skills and knowledge demanded by the jobs they are applying to *before* they apply to the jobs.

The traditional methods for acquiring skills and knowledge is college. Colleges are really expensive. Some cost effective methods include coding bootcamps or self study. Coding bootcamps are there to [guide students through the complicated paths into the software industry](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/what-i-learned-from-researching-coding-bootcamps-f594c15bd9e0)

> Even though bootcamps could be as short as three months, **a full career change into the software industry could take up to a year or more**, which surprised some students. This time could be financially costly for students as well

Bootcamps are not a replacement for putting in the work to:
1. Obtain fundamental computer science knowledge
2. Software industry work experience
3. Online portfolios
4. Networking with employers, software engineers and other students
5. Interviewing abilities (in particular “whiteboarding”)

That's just for software but the same kind of expectations apply for any candidate. Specifically:

1. Fundamental knowledge, as assessed during the knowledge interview or looking at the candidates' college degree / education background
2. Problem solving skills, as asessed during the technical interview
3. Practical experience and ability to "hit the ground running" if they hire you. This is evidenced by your relevant work experience and personal projects.

Networking and interviewing skills are important for getting invited to the job interview.

Non-traditional methods include apprenticeship programs LinkedIn's [REACH](https://careers.linkedin.com/reach/AboutReach):

> LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. This program is designed for candidates who have non-traditional career paths. We encourage applications from candidates without Computer Science degrees who are self-taught, re-entering the workforce, starting second careers, veterans, or those who have attended boot camp style programming courses.

Microsoft offers a similar apprenticeship program called [LEAP](http://www.industryexplorers.com/applicants).


## Resources exist for

Some data which indicate market opportunity in the career pivot and candidate relationship management industry:

* Google announced its new project -  [Google for Jobs](https://www.blog.google/products/search/connecting-more-americans-jobs/) - which addresses the concern that many job seekers feel like they can’t find the job they’re looking for or apply to roles that aren’t the right fit. At the same time [46 percent of U.S. employers face talent shortages and have issues filling open positions with the right candidate](https://www.manpowergroup.us/campaigns/talent-shortage/).
* Based on [the latest coding bootcamp market research](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2017-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research):

    > the number of coding bootcamp graduates has **grown 10x** since the first bootcamps launched in 2012. Coding bootcamps are a $260 million industry and will graduate ~23,000 developers in 2017.

* Political Campaign Members - they make excellent Sales and Business Development team members
* Teachers - their problem solving, management, and communication skills are easily transferable
* Waiters, Baristas, and Retail Associates - They make great customer relations people

Why people make a career pivot? [According to this article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/295131):

* signals for a Career Pivot include:  your job has changed in a fundamental way, your skills are losing value or relevance, You feel restless/unhappy/bored (feeling burnout at work), feeling vulnerable (company's in trouble).
* To prepare for a successful pivot, do two things:  never stop learning and have a passion side project.
