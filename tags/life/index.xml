      <description>&lt;p&gt;I commissioned to serve in the US Navy when I received my university degrees. The service commitment is 5 years. I signed the contract when I was a sophomore in college. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that I wanted to be a tech entrepreneur or wanted to work in the high tech industry when I was in college. It was not until a year after I commissioned that I realized that I prefer a job in innovation and allows me to be creative and indulge in hands-on problem solving. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 5 years exploring my interests and working on closing skills gaps that would preclude me from a smooth transition to a job I would enjoy doing. I did this while still serving in the military.  Here&amp;rsquo;s my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Employee Loyalty Important?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;High-value employees are a major assets for a strong company. Losing a high contributing team member could leave a void and impact the team&amp;rsquo;s morale and workflow. Investors are also concerned by high turnover rates, especially amongst the senior executives. Groupon had trouble retaining their senior executives, which contributed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeNQE3VBRnQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an 85% drop in their value&lt;/a&gt; a year after going public. It&amp;rsquo;s clear we want to &lt;strong&gt;retain&lt;/strong&gt; high-valued employees, but is &lt;strong&gt;employee loyalty&lt;/strong&gt; the way to achieve retention?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you asked me to give you three facts about myself, I would tell you (1) I&amp;rsquo;m a evening and weekend entrepreneur, (2) when I start working on something I enjoy, I can&amp;rsquo;t put it down, and (3) I love coffee. This a formula for disaster because I have a full time job that I have to show up to by 9AM and I&amp;rsquo;m a normal human person who needs at least 6 hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Formal Education Closes Doors To Opportunities</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The average completion rate of Online Open Course (MOOC) certification programs is abysmally low. &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2889436&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A report published in 2016 by researchers at Harvard and MIT&lt;/a&gt; based on 4 years of data indicated an average certification completion rate of just 5.5%. This does not discredit MOOCs to be a good source of quality education content for those looking for good information to improve their understanding for a particular subject; however, the depressing statistics underlines a deeper concern with the ineffectiveness of using a college curriculum to steer people&amp;rsquo;s professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
