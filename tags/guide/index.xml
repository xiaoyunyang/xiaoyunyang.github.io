      <description>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are asked this question during a technical interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When do you use immutable (functional) data structures and when do you use mutable data structure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The coding interviews / coding challenges are designed to assess how productive someone can be with the language. In contrast to the algorithm whiteboarding interview, which assesses how thte candidate go about solving a problem, or the architecture design interview, which assesses how thte candidate&amp;rsquo;s experience in system engineering and product design, the coding interview is is utilized by the company interviewing you to answer one question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you be productive with JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will show you add a rich text editor based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://draftjs.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Draft.js&lt;/a&gt; to your web app. This post is part of the Web Developer Playbook series, created to provide examples, best practice, and suggestions for designing and building web services. I will be using libraries from the JavaScript ecosystem (e.g., Node.js, React.js) in all my examples.

      <title>The Coding Interview: What to Expect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being great at coding interviews doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily make you a great developer and being a great developer doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily make you great at interviews. However, you need to pass the interview to get the job. Most tech companies, public or startups, have started drawing from the same pool of interview material, adopted the same set of coding challenges and problems for candidates to solve. Coding interviews can be challenging and stressful, but with enough practice, research, and preparation, it can be very manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go is becoming pretty mainstream. Every job posting I&amp;rsquo;ve seen recently requires Go as a want-to-have or a need-to-have skill. Here&amp;rsquo;s a guide to help you hit the ground running with Go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The System for Award Management (SAM) is the primary registrant database for entities to do business with the U.S. Government. You must register with SAM before &lt;a href=&#34;https://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/getting-started-with-startup-seed-funding/&#34;&gt;applying for a seed fund from the government&lt;/a&gt; for your startup.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What I love most about programming is the problem solving. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe anyone is born with problem solving skills. It&amp;rsquo;s a muscle that is built and sustained by repeated exercise. Like any exercise, there&amp;rsquo;s a set of guidelines to help you be more effective at developing your problem solving muscles. I will introduce 5 of the most important software design principles that have guided my problem solving process and show you how to apply these principles to solve a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing strikes more anxiety and self-doubt than the dreaded job interview. The thought of participating in an activity designed for the sole purpose of evaluating your worth and the potential for rejection is enough to discourage many people from applying to jobs for which they lack all of the qualifications requested by the job posting. While qualification is important to accomplish the advertised job, it is not everything an employer looks for in a person they want to hire to be a part of the team, to grow with the company and help the company grow. The goal of this article is to provide a guide based on my personal experience for how to prepare for getting offers from jobs for which you don&amp;rsquo;t have all the qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is one of the most popular and versatile languages today, but when Brandon Eich first created JavaScript in 1995, it was not recognized as a general purpose programming language. JavaScript only ran in the browser and was primarily used to enhance the user interfaces of website (e.g., animation, effects upon hover), thus tightly coupled with the Data Object Model (DOM). In recent years, JavaScript has gotten a lot more useful as a general purpose language as it can be run independently from the DOM and browser. Additionally, JavaScript has also has gotten very sophisticated with the introduction of ES6 and ES7. With that, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how JavaScript can be used to solve fundamental problems in computer science. Specifically, let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to write algorithms and leverage data structures to help us solve problems using JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a cheatsheet of all the git commands that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used in my career as a programmer and contributor of open source projects. I&amp;rsquo;m not a git power user (I use about three commands on a daily basis). From time to time, I still use this cheatsheet to for a quick lookup of a special command.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is one of the most popular and versatile languages today. You can build anything in JavaScript: from full stack web apps, to cross platform mobile apps, to cross platform desktop apps. Here are some useful algorithms and syntax in JavaScript to help you be productive in JavaScript right away. No set up necessary. Just  open up your browser&amp;rsquo;s console (hit &lt;code&gt;Cmd&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;Shift&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; if you are using Chrome and Mac) and start typing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is stress? Stress is your subconscious telling you that you have sh*t to do. Feeling stressed about your health? Go to the gym everyday. Feeling stressed about your financial situation? Get a more high paying job. If only things were that simple. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach you how to get rid your stress by understanding where your stress is coming from, then come up with an action plan and execute actions to address the source of your stress. This is not another &amp;ldquo;top 10 things you can do to &amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; article. I will be discussing specific algorithms and heuristics with roots in computer science and mathematics that can be followed for every step of your journey to eliminating the source of your stress.&lt;/p&gt;
