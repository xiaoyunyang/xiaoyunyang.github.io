<a href="http://looseleafapp.com" target="_blank">LooseLeaf</a> is a social bookmarking based learning management platform that delivers relevant learning content to learners and also make the careers of professional online content creators more sustainable. The learning content is in the form of bookmarks crowdsourced and curated by subject matter experts and LooseLeaf's recommendation algorithms.

I began creating LooseLeaf in July 2015. On top of the software engineering and product development for LooseLeaf, I'm also responsible for graphic design, marketing, and PR. Recently I exhibited LooseLeaf at LA <a target="_blank" href="https://techdayhq.com/">TechDay</a>, which is the second TechDay since DC TechDay in 2015 during which I presented the product for public feedback.

I've successfully acquired some beta users for LooseLeaf and am excited to work with them to meet the future milestones for LooseLeaf's product development and marketing goals.

I use Git to maintain positive control over all my different codebases for LooseLeaf's webapp. This includes the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/looseleaf-chrome-plugin">Chrome Plugin</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/looseleaf-frontend">frontend application</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/play-react-d3">backend application</a>, which is effectively decoupled from the frontend application to promote RESTful design and modularity.

<a href="http://number-shapes.com" target="_blank">NumberShapes</a> is a collection of mobile apps that make numbers come alive through numberical visualizations and interactions. In 2014, I worked on the software development for the first few apps, which are iOS matching games that help young learners with familiarization of addition, subtraction, multiplication and other math facts.

</p>

The collection of NumberShapes apps has since grew and one of the apps (NumberShapes Whiteboard) received the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8buAFObSpI" alt="NumberShapes Whiteboard is an award winning app for chilren's technology">Editor's Choice Award from the Children's Technology Review</a>.

While the iOS development has been turned over to my co-founder, Andrew, I still support the development of NumberShape's website, including the <a target="_blank" href="http://number-shapes.com">current official website</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="http://number-shapes.herokuapp.com/#/">prototype website</a> with more features, which is being hosted on heroku. The prototype is created using angular.js, Foundation with SASS, node.js, and express.js.

One of the main design goals of the Scala programming language is to enable developers to tackle the complexity of programming multicore and distributed systems. Scala runs on the JVM and is a more popular language than Haskell with a lot of community and open source software such as Play, Spark, Akka, Kafka, and big users such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Coursera.

The biggest reason I chose Scala on a go-forward basis for my programming specialty is that Scala offers full the functional programming support, but it also lets you do imperative programming and object oriented programming, with seamless interoperability with Java. Functional programming is a good paradigm that lets you make programs that are concise and modular. This is important for developer productivity which I care most about at this time.

Additionally, Scala has a strong type checking system and is statically typed (meaning bugs get caught at compile time vice runtime. With Scala, I don't have to deal with much bugs at all because compiler and type checking helps out tremendously and functional programming reduces complexity of code, thus reducing bugs. For mobile applications, Scala, a statically typed language, enjoys advantages over other JVM languages, such as JRuby or Groovy, because statically typed languages run faster, consume less memory, and generally are better optimized.

I've completed all the available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization">Scala specialization courses on Coursera</a>, and am continuing on with self study with the help of books such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala">Functional Programming in Scala</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.manning.com/books/reactive-web-applications">Reactive Web Applications</a>. As Scala is not ranked as high in terms of programming language popularity, one of the my main tasks in the following months is to write articles, create tutorials, resources, and templates, and speak at events to promote and educate the use of functional programming, scala, and related technologies such as the Play Framework and Spark. Improving the programming community benefits my other projects that use functional (reactive) programming and scala extensively.

When I was planning my trip to Japan with some friends, I thought why not to use this opportunity to make a ReactNative mobile travel app.

ReactNative is a game changer.

It makes the barrier of entry low to make a cross-platform mobile app. The hallmark of Mobile Travel App I made (see <a href="https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/react-native-travel-app" target="_blank">react-native-travel-app</a> repo) is that it took full advantage of the ReactNative open source ecosystem. There is a component for everything you need.

Often times in the javascript ecosystem, you are dealing with a lot of little libraries and you are bringing them together to form a framework that makes sense for your application. So it’s helpful to know what all these little libraries do. Many of them are very simple. But at the end of the day, it’s your job as the developer working in this ecosystem to mix and match them and put them in a composable fashion that makes sense for the application that you are trying to build.

There's no doubt I wouldn't have been where I am without free and high quality content online. Sample projects, code examples, articles, and open source projects are vital to enabling me to be a lifelong learner of the art of programming.  

I enjoy contributing to the online knowledge repository because it helps be a more proficient programmer. I always feel I get a better understanding when I <a href="http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/serverless-webapp/apps/100days.html">create my own sample projects</a> or <a href="http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/#writing">contribute an article on Medium</a>.
