##### __Mission Statement:__
My life aspiration is to help people find personal fulfillment in their work. This is a combination of two things I value: (1) living with purpose and (2) productivity. Jeff Bezos once remarked that we should aspire to achieve "Work-life harmony", which supports my view that we should spend our times doing things that are challenging, interesting, and provide a sense of purpose.

##### __FAQ:__
__What are my hobbies and interests outside of work?__ 

I like to work on interesting side projects, take a MOOCs to update my knowledge/skills, blog on <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@xiaoyunyang">Medium</a>, and read. I recommend anything written by Malcolm Gladwell.

I'm also an avid traveler, having been to many interesting places in Europe (paid for by couchsurfing). My most recent trip was to Japan.

__Why do I want to leave my current job?__

The most important reason is a lack of harmony with my life goals. Opportunities there are limited for me to work on something that has an universal and non-controversial benefit to mankind. I want to work on something that provides opportunities for people to live a more productive and purposeful life, builds bridges, and closes gaps.

__What things am I looking to do more of in my next job and what am I looking to do less of?__

More of -  autonomy in _how_ I do my work. Work-life harmony. Open source contribution.

Less of - The clock-in-clock-out 9 to 5 job. I like more flexibility in when I work and where I work.

__What was a difficult challenge from my previous job?__

There was a project for which I was the lead engineer for my organization. We prepared about a years for it, did everythingt we could to mitigate all the risks we could think of. When the time came to execute the job, a serious issue came up. It was a high-stakes job and the consequence of making a serious mistake was huge. I got a group of people together and we worked out the problem together successfully. We proceeded quickly with caution. Being a part of this project taught me an important life lesson - you can't prepare for everything but having a good relationship with your team and mastering the art of [satisficing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Satisficing) (satisfactory and sufficient decision making strategy) is going to get you through any kind of challenge. 

__How my previous manager describe me__ 

Attention to detail, willing to put in more hours than the 9 to 5 to get the job done. 

__What side project am I working on now?__ 

Japan App: (see repo: [github-for-work](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/JapanApp) - I made this mobile app to help me plan my trip to Japan with friends. This project also got my feet wet in cross-platform mobile app development in ReactNative.

App for work: (see repo: [github-for-work](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/github-for-work)) - it compiles markdown files from coworkers. Provide method to quickly access how-to documents.

__Where do I see yourself in 5 years / 10 years?__

Working in NYC on my own startup or for a startup that helps connect employment and educational opportunities to people looking to improve themselves.


__What's my experience like being a female engineer?__ 

You are going to have a lot of guy friends. That's not a motivation for girls to become engineers. It's just a inevitable side effect.
