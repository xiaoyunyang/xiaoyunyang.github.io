<h1 id="what-is-nsf-seed-fund">What is NSF Seed Fund</h1>

<p>The NSF Seed Fund is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) initiative which provides seed funding for startups that work on innovations with promise of commercial and societal impact. NSF Seed Fund accepts proposals in almost any area of science and technology. NSF Seed Fund is a grant so they take no equity in your company.</p>

<p>As discussed in <a href="http://www.davidcrobinson.com/2015/09/05/part-2-the-rocky-relationship-of-sbir-with-venture-capital/" target="_blank">this article</a>, the NSF Seed Fund offers an effective way for small companies to de-risk technologies that are often too early for venture or even angel investing.</p>

<h2 id="criteria-for-success">Criteria for Success</h2>

<p>There are <a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/resources/review/peer-review/" target="_blank">three criteria</a> for a successful applicant:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong> - the potential to advance knowledge. Metrics for this criterion include the extent in which the proposed activities explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Broader Impacts</strong> - the potential to benefit society. Metrics include the means to assess desired societal impact.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Impact</strong>, which encompasses the potential to lead to significant outcomes in the commercial market. Metrics for this criterion include a compelling potential business model, whether the company possessing a significant and durable competitive advantage over competitors based on technical innovation, and whether there exists a significant market opportunity that could be addressed by the proposed product.</li>
</ol>

<p>For every criterion, the team&rsquo;s qualification would be factored into the assessment to justify the investment. A successful team has the expertise, structure, experience, and resources available in-house or through collaboration to carry out the proposed activities and achieve a successful outcome.</p>

<p>One tip to <a href="http://www.davidcrobinson.com/2015/09/05/part-3-how-to-improve-your-chances-of-success-when-applying-for-an-sbirsttr/" target="_blank">improve your chances of success</a> for the NSF Seed Fund is to make sure you meet all the prerequisites for applying. This includes getting a business license, a DUNS number, register with the government System for Award Management (SAM). Once you&rsquo;ve completed the pre-requisites, you are ready to register with the agency that you think might fund your technology or company. For LooseLeaf, this would be either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Educational Technologies and Applications (EA) - See <a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/portfolio/#educational-technologies-and-applications-ea" target="_blank">EA Categories</a>.</li>
<li>Information Technologies (IT), or Other Topics (OT) - See <a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/topics/information-technologies/" target="_blank">See IT Categories</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/awardees/phase-1/" target="_blank">current Phase I awardees</a> to get a flavor of what kind of startups win NSF Seed Fund.</p>

<h1 id="instruction">Instruction</h1>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18550/nsf18550.htm" target="_blank">SBIR solicitation</a> and the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18551/nsf18551.htm" target="_blank">STTR solicitation</a> includes everything you need to know about applying for funding.</p>

<p>Per the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18550/nsf18550.htm" target="_blank">SBIR Solicitation</a>, successful applicants to the Phase I seed fund will receive a grant up to $225K over a period of 6 to 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>5PM on June 14, 2018</strong> is the deadline for the full application.</li>
<li>1-3 months after the deadline, panel and merit review will be performed.</li>
<li>4-6 months after the deadline, you&rsquo;ll be Notified on whether your proposal is accepted or declined.</li>
<li>5-6 months after the deadline, you&rsquo;ll receive funding of up to $225K if your proposal is accepted.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h1>

<ol>
<li>Incorporate your startup as a LLC, C-Corp, or S-Corp. I used LegalZoom to incorporate LooseLeaf as a single-entity LLC.</li>
<li>Once you obtain documentation to verify your company&rsquo;s existence, you can obtain a DUNS number. I called the number listed on the <a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/get-a-duns.html" target="_blank">Dun &amp; Bradstreet&rsquo;s website</a> to have them email me a link to submit copies of the business documentation. I submitted a Certificate of Organization and EIN Confirmation and Application.</li>
<li>You have to wait a few days for the DUNS number to get entered into the system. Once that happens, you can start your SAM registration.</li>
<li>Register your company with the SBIR. See <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/registration/" target="_blank">https://www.sbir.gov/registration/</a></li>
<li>Once you completed completed your SAM registration, you can begin entering your proposal in FastLane.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sam-registration">SAM Registration</h2>

<p>The System for Award Management (SAM) is the primary registrant database for entities to do business with the U.S. Government. This SAM registration must be maintained with current information at all times during which the organization has an active award or a proposal under consideration by NSF. See the <a href="http://xiaoyunyang.github.io/post/getting-started-with-sam-application/">step-by-step</a> for how I completed the SAM Application for LooseLeaf.</p>

<h2 id="sba-company-registration">SBA Company Registration</h2>

<p>Receipt of a Small Business Concern identification number (SBC ID) is required prior to submission of the proposal. SBA maintains and manages a Company Registry for SBIR/STTR applicants at <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/registration/" target="_blank">https://www.sbir.gov/registration/</a> to track ownership and affiliation requirements. All SBCs must report and/or update ownership information to SBA prior to each SBIR/STTR application submission or if any information changes prior to award. Please see the SBA registration documentation section of the Proposal Submission Instructions.</p>

<h2 id="pre-submittal-feedback-optional">Pre-Submittal Feedback (Optional)</h2>

<p>You fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyZt4vfPc35A4wvbqTANPs11c1KraMq4_bc6hX8jKV307axw/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1" target="_blank">Google Form</a> where you need to answer a few questions about your business:</p>

<p><strong>1. Briefly describe the company and team:</strong></p>

<p>LooseLeaf is an online marketplace and professional networking platform for aspiring newcomers of the tech and creative industries to try out a career path, acquire relevant work experience, professional connections, and mentorship through completing projects for non-profits, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs.</p>

<p>LooseLeaf is founded by a service member-turned software engineer and entrepreneur who has experienced career transition first-hand and brings the right skills, insight, and determination to build the best online incubator for budding tech and creative talents.</p>

<p><strong>2. Describe the market opportunity, value proposition, and customers (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words):</strong></p>

<p>There is a long-held belief that a college education and internships are necessary prerequisites for developing marketable skills and obtaining relevant work experience. The advent of massive open online courses (MOOCs) and coding bootcamps have offered alternatives to the traditional education-to-work pipeline but fall short in offering the same benefits which universities and internships provide, in particular, the ability to advance through a career development process with peers, networking with professionals and recruiters, and a clear path to employment with the activities being done through these platforms.</p>

<p>LooseLeaf is a platform for newcomers of the tech and creative industries to improve their skills and resumes by working on projects for non-profits and entrepreneurs. LooseLeaf serves a two-sided market: (1) the newcomers who look for career building opportunities and (2) the non-profits and entrepreneurs looking for a way to de-risk and minimize cost for their operations. By addressing all of the necessary components for career building and adding the benefits of being free to use and asynchronous, LooseLeaf is instrumental for people who are in the midst of changing careers, graduating college students, and graduating high school students.</p>

<p><strong>3. Describe the technology/innovation (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)</strong></p>

<p>The major challenges of self-study for career advancement include the lack of insight on what skills to build, what to work on to build skills, and how the skill building activity will improve chance of employment in a chosen career track. LooseLeaf&rsquo;s innovation specifically address these challenges by integrating data from job boards and profile of companies who are posting to these job boards into LooseLeaf&rsquo;s information system to inform newcomers on how to work on each project to maximize their return-on-investment with regard to in-demand skills.</p>

<p>Another challenge of self-study is the ability to stay motivated and focused to effectively filter through and utilize the massive collection of free learning resources online. LooseLeaf&rsquo;s second innovation is the integration of social networking features to create a peer mentorship system, in which newcomers can observe what someone else of at their experience level would do to complete a project like making a landing page for a non-profit or a logo for a startup founder and provide encouragement and feedback to each other during the project completion process. The peer mentorship system group newcomers of similar skill level, aspirations, and interest areas, and shared projects to create social networks. When newcomers browse open projects in areas of their interest, they can add the projects they want to work on to their todo-list and watch-list. They can document their efforts in how they are completing these projects, which sends notifications to other newcomers in their network.<br />
  * Note to Self:  TODO:  (1) a daily/weekly digest email that is sent to a newcomer&rsquo;s inbox which consist of the activities of how other newcomers are completing their projects and (2) a tool for other newcomers to interact with that newcomer&rsquo;s action plan and milestones updates.
  * To allow newcomers to browse open projects in the marketplace to acquire relevant work experience for working at a companies, professional connections, and mentorship.</p>

<ul>
<li>The newcomers can browse open projects in the marketplace posted by non-profits, entrepreneurs, and other newcomers to work on to acquire relevant work experience, professional connections, and mentorship. There is no limit to how many people can work on each project.</li>
<li>Newcomers can browse open projects in areas of their interest and add the projects they want to work on to their todo-list and watch-list. They can document their efforts in how they are completing these projects, and receive notifications of how other people are completing their projects.</li>

<li><p>The project creators provide direct feedback for all those who contribute a deliverable to the projects. A history of completed projects and the feedback received is accumulated on a newcomer&rsquo;s profile, which provides an overview of the newcomer&rsquo;s abilities.</p></li>

<li><p>Non-profits, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs post projects they need help with in exchange for offering mentorship and feedback to everyone working on the projects. There is no money exchanged for working on these projects so there is no limit to how many people can work on each project.</p></li>

<li><p>Newcomers can browse open projects in areas of their interest and add the projects they want to work on to their todo-list and watch-list. They can document their efforts in how they are completing these projects, and receive notifications of how other people are completing their projects. While all submittals to a project receives a shout-out and reviews from the project creator, the best submittal receives a badge. The best submittal is judged by the project creator and the community. Over time, newcomers will have a portfolio of sample work, reviews, and shout-outs will be created and skills acquired through the various projects.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Side Note</em>, When the newcomers are browsing open projects in areas of their interests and can add it to their todo-list or ignore it, giving feedback to the project creator why (not interesting, project description too vague, no clear goal for the deliverable).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Describe the technical challenges to overcome (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. Describe the competition (1-2 paragraphs or up to 500 words)</strong></p>

<p>LooseLeaf distinguishes itself from its competitors by democratizing
Similar to the MOOC, there is no limit to how many people can work on each project. In that respect, LooseLeaf distinguishes itself from freelancing websites in which the career/skill building opportunities are limited to the most experienced and qualified freelancers and working professionals.</p>

<p>Although freelancing websites exist, the steep cost of working with a freelancer deters entrepreneurs and non-profits who are not well-funded.</p>

<p>LooseLeaf provides a platform for newcomers of the tech and creative industries to improve their skills and resumes by working on projects for non-profits and entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>exploration of a new career track, a support network with peer-to-peer assistance and mentorship, and a platform to accumulate and showcase relevant work experience and inform recruiters</p>

<p><strong>6. In which topic area does the technology best fit?</strong></p>

<p>EA (Education Technologies and Application, specifically EA7 (Education &amp; Training for the Emerging Fourth Sector Eco-system EA7) best describes LooseLeaf because because LooseLeaf model of professional development is a substitute for the unsustainable cycle of higher education and debt. Problem solving and mentorship are essential to skill building and professional development.</p>

<h2 id="1-job-insights">1. Job Insights</h2>

<p>The first cornerstone for LooseLeaf&rsquo;s product is to demystify the career track by offering new career seekers a preview of the available job opportunities and the type of skills and experience a successful candidate must possess. The best way to get that insight is from <strong>Job boards</strong>.  Job boards are a type of search engine which aggregate and display jobs posted by employers seeking new employees. These job boards often target one specific industry like technology, design. They are among the most popular sites on the Internet.</p>

<p>Based on Betterteam&rsquo;s ranking for <a href="https://www.betterteam.com/job-boards" target="_blank">best Job Board</a>, Indeed, Glassdoor, Craigslist, LinkedIn, Facebook are considered some of the best general job boards. There are some specialized job boards. There are many jobs <a href="https://careersidekick.com/best-tech-job-boards/" target="_blank">specializing in tech jobs</a></p>

<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Investigate each of the job boards below to determine if they have an API for third party developers to access data on jobs.</p>

<h2 id="2-skills-knowledge-and-portfolio-building">2. Skills, Knowledge, and Portfolio Building</h2>

<p>The second cornerstone of LooseLeaf&rsquo;s product is the skills, knowledge, and portfolio building. Based on <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2017-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research" target="_blank">the latest coding bootcamp market research</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the number of coding bootcamp graduates has <strong>grown 10x</strong> since the first bootcamps launched in 2012. Coding bootcamps are a $260 million industry and will graduate ~23,000 developers in 2017.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few concerns with using a bootcamp to close the skills and experience gap:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cost - Average tuition price of qualifying courses is ~$11,400.</li>
<li>Format - An average program length of 14.1 weeks. Bootcamps are trending longer – up from 12.9 weeks in 2016 to add computer science basics to the curriculum. If you never coded in your life, 13 weeks is not going to be enough to be a good software developer. Coding and problem solving skills are like muscle that you need to build up with practice.</li>
<li>Exclusivity - There are prep schools for coding bootcamps. You have to be accepted into the bootcamp, like college. Many people are working a full time job, with bills, mortgage, and a family, so they can&rsquo;t drop everything to attend a bootcamp. Also, there&rsquo;re no bootcamps for content creators and designers looking to hone their skills through lots of practice.</li>
</ol>

<p>We help career-changers try out the careers they want to enter by working on projects for non-profits, entrepreneurs, and intrapreneurs for free. In exchange, they get feedback from their clients and get a feel for what it&rsquo;s like to work as a developer, designer, or writer.</p>

<p>When you work for free, you&rsquo;re not working for exposure. Freelancers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeVj-ASeGLs" target="_blank">work for gratitude, shout-outs, and opportunities that this would lead to something else</a>. It&rsquo;s often your initiative and may materialize to something down the line.</p>

<h2 id="3-candidate-sourcing">3. Candidate Sourcing</h2>

<p>The last cornerstone of LooseLeaf&rsquo;s product is the candidate sourcing, which is a combination of the Recruitment Candidate Relationship Manage System (CRM) and Application Tracking System (ATS).</p>

<p>CRM is used by recruiters and a company&rsquo;s talent sourcing team <a href="https://blog.beamery.com/ats-vs-crm/" target="_blank">to identify strong active and passive candidates</a> and encourage them to apply to the position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>CRM:</strong> Your candidate relationship management system is for job seekers and candidates. It’s the engine that drives your sourcing team, lets you create talent pools and helps you build and nurture relationships with passive talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ATS is used by the hiring team to track and automate some of the processes for job applicants to go through each stage of the hiring process. Many employers are <a href="https://www.betterteam.com/applicant-tracking-system" target="_blank">having difficulty</a> finding candidates or sorting through the vast number of applicants they get.</p>

<p>Many ATS systems offer additional features, such as note taking, bulk emailing, and job posting. ATS works by tracking who has applied for each job, when they applied, and what stages of the hiring process they&rsquo;ve gone through and still need to go through. Some ATS also integrates <strong>CV scanner</strong> (i.e., allow CVs to be searched and filtered quickly to filter out candidates), <strong>assessment platform</strong> (e.g., candidate testing platforms, including code testing, video interviewing, personality testing, and more), and <strong>Recruiting CRM</strong> (candidate relationship management system for job seekers, candidates)</p>

<p>There are a <a href="https://www.betterteam.com/top-job-posting-sites" target="_blank">whole plethora of recruiting websites</a> dedicated to posting jobs, integrating Applicant Tracking Software (ATS), and hiring qualified candidates. Many of them have APIs for the companies posting jobs since they are the customers. Few have APIs for third party developers to acquire data from job postings to inform a talented but not-yet-qualified candidate on what the opportunities are and in what areas they need to build their skills and experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://dev.smartrecruiters.com/customer-api/posting-api/endpoints/postings/" target="_blank">SmartRecruiters API</a> lets you grab active postings published by given company. Companies posting jobs using SmartRecruiters include Atlassian (See <a href="https://www.smartrecruiters.com/Atlassian/743999668426546" target="_blank">example</a>).</li>

<li><p>Not Friendly to 3rd Party Developers (Yet).</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html#job-posts" target="_blank">Greenhouse.io API</a> provides Job Posts, which provides online job posts for a particular organization&rsquo;s jobs. I don&rsquo;t think they offer third party developers access to the job postings. Companies using Greenhouse includes Github (See <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1137157#.Wu9pxdPwZZ0" target="_blank">example</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://workable.readme.io/docs/jobs" target="_blank">Workable API</a>. They have an API, but it’s only for paying customers (i.e., employers) to access and manage their own data: <a href="https://workable.readme.io/docs/generate-an-access-token)" target="_blank">https://workable.readme.io/docs/generate-an-access-token)</a> seems to be only for  paying customers (i.e., employers) to access and manage their own data. ActionIQ and Gitbook use workable to post jobs. See example <a href="https://actioniq.workable.com/j/610FFCEB61" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://gitbook.workable.com/j/7F8654B9FD" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Put simply, your ATS is a workflow and compliance tool that manages applicants, your CRM is an ecosystem of all passive and active candidates, as well as everyone who has previously applied to your company. It’s a <strong>complete talent intelligence hub</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="market-opportunity">Market Opportunity</h1>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLcM4iZSTo" target="_blank">skills gap</a> is a major contributor of unemployment and underemployment. Low skilled work opportunities are disappearing, being automated away. Companies are in the business of educating workers. They are not schools and many have few resources to train new hires. New hires are expected to acquire the skills and knowledge demanded by the jobs they are applying to <em>before</em> they apply to the jobs.</p>

<p>The traditional methods for acquiring skills and knowledge is college. Colleges are really expensive. Some cost effective methods include coding bootcamps or self study. Coding bootcamps are there to <a href="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/what-i-learned-from-researching-coding-bootcamps-f594c15bd9e0" target="_blank">guide students through the complicated paths into the software industry</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though bootcamps could be as short as three months, <strong>a full career change into the software industry could take up to a year or more</strong>, which surprised some students. This time could be financially costly for students as well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bootcamps are not a replacement for putting in the work to:
1. Obtain fundamental computer science knowledge
2. Software industry work experience
3. Online portfolios
4. Networking with employers, software engineers and other students
5. Interviewing abilities (in particular “whiteboarding”)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just for software but the same kind of expectations apply for any candidate. Specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fundamental knowledge, as assessed during the knowledge interview or looking at the candidates&rsquo; college degree / education background</li>
<li>Problem solving skills, as asessed during the technical interview</li>
<li>Practical experience and ability to &ldquo;hit the ground running&rdquo; if they hire you. This is evidenced by your relevant work experience and personal projects.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Networking and practical experience (portfolio) are important for getting invited to the job interview.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/10/05/will-mooc-help-you-open-career-doors/pmjHbLCghsH0lEbulWC9VL/story.html" target="_blank">A Boston Globe article</a> notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While MOOCs seem like they can only enhance a job candidate’s appeal, many people I talked to noted an important shift in the world of hiring. Credentials, whether a MOOC certificate or an MBA degree, are declining in importance, while <strong>portfolios are on the rise</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s a portfolio?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some sort of <strong>evidence of your expertise and abilities</strong> online, like design work showcased on Dribbble.com, software code on GitHub, a mobile app you’ve built, or a sales presentation you developed and posted to SlideShare. “Education is becoming less than 10 percent of a candidate’s total score when we hire,” says Apollo Sinkevicius, managing director at One Mighty Roar, a Boston design and innovation firm. Portfolios and work samples “have the highest weight in my hiring,” he says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Relevant Work Experience?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Non-traditional methods include apprenticeship programs LinkedIn&rsquo;s <a href="https://careers.linkedin.com/reach/AboutReach" target="_blank">REACH</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LinkedIn’s vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. This program is designed for candidates who have non-traditional career paths. We encourage applications from candidates without Computer Science degrees who are self-taught, re-entering the workforce, starting second careers, veterans, or those who have attended boot camp style programming courses.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>Microsoft offers a similar apprenticeship program called <a href="http://www.industryexplorers.com/applicants" target="_blank">LEAP</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some data which indicate market opportunity in the career pivot and candidate relationship management industry:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google announced its new project -  <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/connecting-more-americans-jobs/" target="_blank">Google for Jobs</a> - which addresses the concern that many job seekers feel like they can’t find the job they’re looking for or apply to roles that aren’t the right fit. At the same time <a href="https://www.manpowergroup.us/campaigns/talent-shortage/" target="_blank">46 percent of U.S. employers face talent shortages and have issues filling open positions with the right candidate</a>.</li>

<li><p>Based on <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2017-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research" target="_blank">the latest coding bootcamp market research</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the number of coding bootcamp graduates has <strong>grown 10x</strong> since the first bootcamps launched in 2012. Coding bootcamps are a $260 million industry and will graduate ~23,000 developers in 2017.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p><a href="https://techbeacon.com/bootcamps-wont-make-you-coder-heres-what-will" target="_blank">TechBeacon</a> reported that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a recent review of bootcamps, TechBeacon found that 17 of 24 programs claimed that 90% or more of their students got full-time programming jobs or freelancing positions within six-to-12 months of graduation. But those numbers can be misleading. According to the Coding Bootcamp Market Sizing Report, the developer job market is <a href="https://medium.com/@marceldegas/san-francisco-bootcamp-bubble-cee59e48bf3e#.64f229tc9" target="_blank">flooded with bootcamp graduates</a>, and that makes it hard for individual graduates to stand out.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottomline</strong> is job seekers need to stand out from the crowd with portfolio and sample work online which provide evidence for their abilities and talent.</p>

<h2 id="market-research">Market Research</h2>

<p><strong>We Expect LooseLeaf users to be:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>MOOC users looking to build careers, a subset of which attend coding and UX design bootcamps.</li>
<li>Looking for project opportunities beyond formal education or MOOCs to stand out from the crowd.</li>
<li>Those who are desperate/committed enough to pay $11K and spend 14 weeks in an intensive coding bootcamp. The typical bootcamper is is college educated working professional in their late 20s and early 30s looking for a career change.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tam-sam-som">TAM, SAM, SOM</h3>

<p><strong>TAM: Accept</strong></p>

<p>Total Addressable Market (TAM) is everyone you wish to reach with your product. For estimating the TAM, we use the MOOC market size as baseline:</p>

<ul>
<li>USD 1.83 Billion in 2015 to USD 8.50 Billion by 2020, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.0% (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/massive-open-online-course-mooc-market-size-to-grow-from-usd-183-billion-in-2015-to-usd-850-billion-by-2020-561561611.html" target="_blank">Source</a>).</li>
<li>There are 81M students on MOOC (<a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/mooc-stats-2017/" target="_blank">Source</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SAM: Attract</strong></p>

<p>Serviceable Available Market (SAM) is the portion of the TAM that we can actually address.
According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/whos-benefiting-from-moocs-and-why" target="_blank">a Harvard Business Review Survey</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Career benefits are the more common reason for taking a MOOC. <strong>Fifty-two percent</strong> of the people surveyed report a primary goal of improving their current job or finding a new job — they are “career builders.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As such, we are estimating that 52% of 81M students or <strong>42M users</strong> as our SAM.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/can-moocs-solve-your-training-problem" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review survey</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>one-fifth of those surveyed said they enrolled in MOOCs solely in the hope of finding a new job or starting a business. Rather, many people look at these courses as part of their self-directed career development, whether they have a clearly defined plan or are working toward broader objectives, such as maintaining their overall employability and keeping their skill set up-to-date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LooseLeaf can put the concepts they learn from MOOCs into context.</p>

<p><strong>SOM: Own</strong></p>

<p>Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) is the realistic prediction of our ability to acquire share of our SAM, considering competition, locality, our distribution and sales channels and any other market influences.</p>

<p>Coding Bootcamp Market Size: $260M industry, graduating 23K developers in 2017, and has grown 10x since founded in 2012 <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2017-coding-bootcamp-market-size-research" target="_blank">Source</a>.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a software design pattern that allows you to think about problems in terms of objects and their interactions. OOP is typically done with classes or with prototypes. Most languages that implement OOP (e.g., Java, C++, Ruby, Python) use class-based inheritance. JavaScript implements OOP via Prototypal inheritance. In this article, I&rsquo;m going to show you how to use both approaches for OOP in JavaScript, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches of OOP and introduce an alternative for OOP for designing more modular and scalable applications.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>What I love most about programming is the problem solving. I don&rsquo;t believe anyone is born with problem solving skills. It&rsquo;s a muscle that is built and sustained by repeated exercise. Like any exercise, there&rsquo;s a set of guidelines to help you be more effective at developing your problem solving muscles. I will introduce 5 of the most important software design principles that have guided my problem solving process and show you how to apply these principles to solve a real problem.</p></div>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>Nothing strikes more anxiety and self-doubt than the dreaded job interview. The thought of participating in an activity designed for the sole purpose of evaluating your worth and the potential for rejection is enough to discourage many people from applying to jobs for which they lack all of the qualifications requested by the job posting. While qualification is important to accomplish the advertised job, it is not everything an employer looks for in a person they want to hire to be a part of the team, to grow with the company and help the company grow. The goal of this article is to provide a guide based on my personal experience for how to prepare for getting offers from jobs for which you don&rsquo;t have all the qualifications.</p></div>
