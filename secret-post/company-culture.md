High-value employees are hard to come by. Attracting top talent is a goal that every company in the world strives to achieve but for a young company, hiring a top talent who is a wrong culture fit could be an disastrous mistake. This article discusses how does a startup should build its culture and hire talented people who are the right culture fit. This article also documents my process and journey for establishing a culture for [LooseLeaf](https://www.halosinsurance.com/), a startup for which I am CEO.

# Case Study

One way to learn more about how to build a successful company with a great culture is to look at some examples of an existing company to see what they are doing right and wrong. The examples are anecdotal as they are from my personal experience and observations. There's a website called [Key Values](https://www.keyvalues.com/), designed to help software engineers find engineering teams that share their values, that could provide additional metrics and some quantitative insights and examples for engineering cultures.

### Facebook

I had the opportunity to attend a Facebook recruiting Happy Hour where I got to talk to a few software engineers, engineering managers, and product managers to get a better picture of the culture and organizational structure at Facebook. I've been a fan of [Facebook's open source initiatives](https://opensource.fb.com/), in particular [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql), and [the Facebook OAuth API auth](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web).

**Open Source at Facebook**

I asked a software engineer at Facebook about the open sourcing culture and his response was in line with what I expected. The business case for open sourcing the building blocks of your software infrastructure is you have a large community of developers to report bugs, provide suggestions, and to help you maintain high quality software and drive positive changes to improve your product.

An important but less obvious benefit of a company to open source parts of their software suite is recruiting. Talented developers are more likely to want to work at a company who developed software that they already love to use. On the other hand, the company can hire developers who can "hit the ground running" because they already know how to work with some of the software works. The software engineer brought up the important point that there is a cost to maintaining the open source projects. There was a library that Facebook released a while back that was just out there and no one was assigned to maintain it, resulting in the library fading into obscurity. Maintaining your software as an open source rather than something that is only available in-house has the added overhead of needing to get permission from the entire open source community users to make a change rather than just a much smaller group of in-house developers.

Another insight from the conversation with the Facebook engineer was there is no DevOps team. Every software engineer at Facebook has cradle-to-grave responsibility of the piece of software he/she owns. This is consistent with the engineering culture at Naval Reactors, which I will discuss later. Facebook's culture seems similar to [Spotify's Squad Framework](https://medium.com/project-management-learnings/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761).

### Amazon

**Work-life harmony**

Amazon has a get-shit-done / goal-oriented engineering culture. From the stories I've heard, Amazon employees are expected to meet their goals of the week and if they fail to do so, they go on probation. Go on enough probations and you are fired. This is a pretty ruthless way of running a company and I don't expect anything less from Jeff Bezos. A problem I see with this culture is people would burn out or become narrow-minded if they are really focused on nothing but work to meet their quotas. From an outsider's perspective, the motivation to complete work at Amazon seems to be extrinsic and fear-based. Amazon employees are also less likely to work on side projects because Amazon makes their new hires sign a contract that stipulates that anything the employee makes at work or outside of work, which is remotely related to Amazon's software products belongs to Amazon.

From a work-life balance perspective, Amazon ranks low amongst the other top tech companies. This is probably an artifact of Jeff Bezos' personal philosophy, as evident in [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTYFEgXaRbU) during which he deflected the question about Amazon's harsh work environment. In short, Bezos's response is

In a way, I agree with [Jeff Bezos's notion of work-life harmony](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/316814) but not exactly the way he implements it at Amazon.

I believe that you can't hire people who will just work hard for you because they enjoy working. You have to give them a reason to work hard. A great company develops the individual, teaches them how to work smart to be more efficient with their time so they can get their work done and have free time to experience other things in life. Being able to experience things outside of work and work on side projects are important to motivation, creativity, and overall sense of wellbeing. Rigid routine and the repetitiveness of job have a stultifying effect on employee engagement and creativity.

# Personality and Personal Values

For a new company, the founders are the first members of the team. Finding the first employee to hire means finding a person who would be a great addition to the existing team and can effectively collaborate and form a good relationship with the founders. It would be a mistake to hire someone who is a superstar but cannot work with the founders due to large differences in personality and values. Below are some questions to answer that can help to identify these key difference that would paralyze team work:

* What's your problem solving approach? Are you process oriented or act more on intuition?
* Do you see challenges as a roadblock that hinders progress or as an opportunities to prove yourself and learn? In other words, are you goal oriented or growth oriented?
* Are you more of a night owl or morning person?
* Do you see challenges as obstacles to achieving your goal or as challenges to be surmounted, and they want to be the ones responsible for surmounting them
* What do you fear more? Failing or missing out?

We need to baseline the candidates' personality, work habits, and personal values with those of our own to assess whether they are someone that we can work with. The following describe me:

* I'm very process oriented.
* I hope for the best but prepare for the worst.
* I hate to see mistakes repeated. Documenting lessons learned, reflecting on actions in the past are what I do to prevent mistakes from being repeated.
* I have no patience with inefficiency. I read productivity books like Algorithms to Live By and refactor my processes to eliminate inefficiencies.
* Career focused. I don’t see success in career as a means to an end but as a way to get paid to do what I love.
* Extreme attention to detail but not paralyzed by unimportant things. Be able to tell important/urgent from important/not urgent and important/not important to be able to prioritize and get things done.
* I have a “get shit done” attitude.
* I need to have a wealth of different experiences to
* Have a goal. Ruthlessly pursue that goal, but be open minded to know when to pivot when you need to pivot.

# Conclusion

### Open Source:
**Pro:**  

* Instills a sense of purpose in the team to drive high quality. When you build/maintain software products that are open sourced, you are more motivated to do a good job because you are not only doing it for the benefit of the company but you are also helping to empower developers around the world (**Purpose**).
* Great for recruiting and visibility of the company.
* More people to break your code and give suggestions for bugs and improvements.
* Forces you to document your code, which is in general a good thing.

**Con:**

* Overhead of coordinating with the community.

### Work-life Harmony:
As discussed above, I agree with Jeff Bezos's aspiration of a work-life harmony but not the way he implements it at Amazon.

We should ensure a work-life harmony culture without a harsh and intimidating work environment by encouraging employees to develop interests and work on side projects outside of work that overlaps with what the company needs. The more overlap, the better. We want to support employees obtaining useful skills on their own in their free time but we don't want to force everyone to take a Coursera class.

One way to have a culture like this is to hire people who enjoys working on professional development outside of work. Ask the candidate "What are you doing when you have time off?" If their response does not include activities that help them attain mastery in their domain or related to skills or knowledge building to make them better at their job, then forget it.

Another thing we could try is to recognize and promote one employee's outside activities to give the other employees some ideas and motivation for what productive things they can do outside of work to make them better at their job.
